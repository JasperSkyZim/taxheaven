# PART 4: POLITICAL CHANGE TOOLKIT

# 4-1: Collective Action
Climate Change has been described as a 'super-wicked' problem. What does this mean? It has characteristics of wickedness plus more.

## Two Traditions in Political Science

In this section we will describe the theory of collective action. there are two major traditions in political science. The rational choice perspective and the cultural perspective. Rational choice sees politics as the interaction between rational agents. Whereas cultural studies sees particular ways of behaving as being enduring, defined by 'culture'. 

The two perspectives are perhaps a dual to one another. For rational choice requires some sort of consistency of preference, interest or behaviour.  And it is this persistence that creates the cultural continuity that is the subject of cultural studies. So onwards, now, with the rational choice approach to collective action.Much of what follows is, I suppose, related to the rational choice literature. But we will also consider the cultural studies tradition.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

The two most famous fables are known as the prisoners dilemma and the tragedy of the commons. The prisoner's dilemma considers two prisoners in a tricky situation. The outcome of the game depends on what the others do. They have two choices to grass up the the co-defendant or to stay quiet. If they both grass, they get a long sentence. But if they cooperate they will get off with a small sentence. However, if one of them cooperates then they will 

## The Tragedy of The Commons

We've already met the tragedy of the commons in our earlier parable on our Tea Island Archipelago. Where access rights are unlimited to a common resource, that resource can be overwhelmed. Say we have a common and everyone has rights to graze on the common. Unless the rights to graze cattle on the common are controlled, it's likely that the common will be overgrazed. Why? Each person sees only the benefit of grazing, whereas the cost in terms of the reduction in the grazing that others can do is shared over everyone else involved. 

## The Logic of Collective Action

The logic of collective action also covers whether groups will act in their collective self interest. Let's say a group of individuals has some collective interest in some matter. Will that group act in its own interest? Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action studies this question. His conclusion was that groups do not always act in their own self interest. Unless they can motivate the members of the group to car about the things that they all have in common then individuals behaving selfishly will not necessarily uphold the interest of the group.

Olson suggests that it is only when the group can coerce its members or when there are members of the group with a *concentrated interest* where action to protect the interest of the group is likely. When everyone has only a weak stake in their collective good then little action is likely.

## Evolutionary Game Theory

The prisoner's dilemma produces different outcomes when repeated. When games are repeated, different strategies can evolve. If an agent has defected in one time period they are less likely to be trusted in the next. Furthermore another playing entity can punish or reward past behaviour. In this context the so called 'tit for tat' strategy is considered a good one. Tit-for-tat punishes a past indiscretion. The 'generous tit-for tat' usually punishes defection, but also occasionally, generously, does not.

## Collective Individualism

A trite oversimplification of the ideological clash of the cold war would be this. On one hand was (*individualism*). Under individualism the *market* determines outcomes and is the interaction of *individual preferences*. (there might be some voting process too, but this is viewed as non-core to the political system). In the collectivist system, the government determines the outcome. In addition there is a certain enforced conformity. New ideas are not welcome.

I want to describe a sort of synthesis. One synthesis is the distributed ownership of collective property such as land. In this we see the ideas of Henry George.

Another is an individual approach to *collective* provision. Consider a community bakery. On one hand this could  be considered a provider of private goods. But on another it's a provider of a sort of public service. the community needs a bakery. It doesn't need two bakeries (unless it is a rather big community). 

So what determines prices? Well in a small community, it's more likely that the community will determine a 'fair price'. The goodwill of the community is important. The community gets together and knows each other. They can decide to go elsewhere or set up a new bakery if the prices are too high or the quality too low.

These two examples show that if there are pervasive and important public goods 



## 'As if' Altruism

Another useful way of thinking was described in the *Social Limits To Growth* by Fred Hirsch. Hirsh's book is famous for the idea of 'positional goods'. Unlike goods that are augmentable, positional goods are those that are essentially fixed. Later in the book, Hirsch describes a decaying moral legacy. He describes 'as if' altruism. As if altruism is a tValue of your vote

We can distinguish between the scarcity of a vote and the scarcity of free time.

## Diminishing Returns

The world is not homogeneous. Imagine plots of land. You have a choice of what plots of land to farm. It makes sense that you would farm the easiest, most productive land first. Thus, as agriculture is expanded, the deployment of additional land suffers diminishing returns. As land area is expanded, the productivity of the new plots is less than those of the existing plots. Diminishing returns are a product that firstly the world has variability and secondly prioritisation. If we take the best plots first, then inevitably the ones left are less good.

Diminishing returns can also be found in a different context. Let's say we can add one factor to a process: for example labour power, but another factor is fixed (for example perhaps there is a limited number of machines).
