Quick How-to guide A: for refs
1) Make sure the references are in the shared folder All tax and benefits reform
2) Create your own subfolder of Library called HeatherPC
3) Sync Mendeley to that folder using Tools>Options>Bibtex
4) Change the bibliography line at the top of the TaxHeaven.Rmd to point to that file (we have three files, each the same, to avoid sync issues)

Quick How to guide B: for knitting
5) Turn off any automatic M-dashes of N-dashes or fancy quotes (search for them before saving/switching to R)
6) Always save in UTF-8 coding in R (file-save as encoding) 
7) Check individual file knits in R (you will need to use the .Rmd file format and add the front matter)
8) Check the whole TaxHeaven file knits and there are no missing refs (It will still knit even with missing refs)
