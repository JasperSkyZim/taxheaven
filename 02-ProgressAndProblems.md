# PART 2: THE FUTURE -- AN ECONOMY FIT FOR OUR CHILDREN?

Are you looking for a new economic model for your country? 

This book is addressed to economists, scientists, politicians, business people, other professionals and interested members of the general public who are interested in this problem. This chapter constitutes a summary of the book as a whole.

Many people, across the west, whether they are rich or poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well-informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues such as climate change. The super rich are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve its problems.

What would an economy fit for our children look like? A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus, we argue for a society and economy that defines, creates, preserves and fairly distributes natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. An economy that is good for people and for the planet is one that functions well. 

To define such a society, we need first to consider a question of economics. What are the economic conditions for sustainable and widely-spread prosperity?

# What are the Economic Conditions for Sustainable Widely-Spread Prosperty (Chapter 3)

This book is about the economic conditions for sustainable and widely spread prosperity.

The economist Adam Smith wrote perhaps the most famous book on economics, *The Wealth of Nations* more than two centuries ago. He was writing at the time of three revolutions: the political revolution in America and France, the industrial revolution that was just beginning in Britain, and the intellectual revolution that he himself played a part in.

Since Smith's day, there has been tremendous technological progress and economic growth. But we still have problems. We have economic insecurity and pollution. 

Why, given great technological and economic progress, do we still have problems? Why, amid so much wealth, are many of our lives so economically precarious? In the 1960s, in the UK it took an average personon average wages four years wages to buy their own home. Why now does it take an average person on average wages ten years to buy the same home? [PROVIDE DATA] Many of us are just about managing when we should be prospering. 

The 19th century writer Henry George's book *Progress and Poverty* asked a similar question. Why, given technological progress, was there so much poverty? George argued that it was the private ownership of land that caused poverty. It was landowners that tended 

If we have the technology to solve our environmental problems, then why are we not solving them? Our environmental problems are becoming increasingly critical. Why is there environmental pollution, despite having the wealth and technological ability to prevent it? 

Our economic system is not allowing us to take full advantage of the technological progress that we make. So we seek the answers in economics, or, as it used to be called *political economy*.

## ECONOMIC THOUGHT

Economics is the study of activities that are, at least in part, motivated by financial gain. Economics used to be called *political economy*. This term comes from the Ancient Greek. *Polis* means the city-state, the name for the political organisation in ancient Greece. Economy comes from two Greek words *Oikos*, meaning household, and *Nomos* meaning law. Therefore, *Oikonomos* means household management. Classical political economy includes the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx. 

The works of political economy by the great authors often had questions of taxation and property at their heart. Taxation is considered on two grounds. Does it aid efficiency and is it fair? 

Classical political economy considered how the economy distributed its gains.  At the heart of political economy has always been the question of just distribution. Taxation is a means to remedy the situation when distribution is inefficient or unfair, as well as being a way to pay for public goods.

This makes political economy -- and now economics -- powerful. Also, it means that economics has implications for the financial interests of everyone. One can believe an economic theory for scientific reasons, but one might also support some theory because it furthers one's own interests. This makes political and economic discourse somewhat fraught. It also means that there is a suspicion that the corrupting power of self-interest may affect the balance of those economic theories that are thought authoritative. 

These questions are related not only to economic processes -- for example, production and competition -- but also to taxation and the structure of private property. What assets can be owned? And, who in fact owns the assets? And how much tax should they pay for owning assets or for engaging in economic activity? Desirable economic outcomes depend not only on economic activity but also on the taxation system and the system of property rights.

In our chapter on economics, we define some classical economic problems. How are prices determined? How does the economy distribute the gains from economic progress? Does self interest and the free market provide a desirable outcome? In this book, we aim to reconcile classical, neoclassical, Keynesian and modern system dynamic economic thinking to give a more authoritative approach.

Our starting point is Adam Smith's model, since this has helped to define the core economic view in the two and half centuries that followed.

## ADAM SMITH'S MODEL

We have a market economy with competition, growth and technological progress. Adam Smith, in his famous work *The Wealth of Nations*, set out an economic model of how economic growth could lead to widely-spread prosperity. He argued that the division of labour leads to higher levels of productivity.

If an entrepreneur makes an improvement in production processes, he can lower his cost of production and still sell at the price of his competitors. In other words, he can make a profit. In the short term, therefore, the advantages of his improvement accrue to him. Thus, the profit motive provides an incentive to make improvements.

His competitors may notice the improvement that he has made and replicate it. To capture market share, they will lower their prices towards the new cost of production. There might be a price war to capture customers. After the competition has taken its course, we will be left with a different situation. The price of the good concerned will have fallen to just above the new production cost. The new beneficiary of the technological improvement would be everyone who purchases the product. Technological progress, the profit motive and competition would lead to widely spread prosperity.

# What is an efficient and fair taxation system given what we know about the principles of political economy? 

## RENT!

So why do we have these problems of pollution and precariousness? We identify two phenomena described by the great economists. Economic Rent and Economic Theft.

Adam Smith's model relies on certain assumptions. A production process, once improved, can be replicated. There must be enough market participants for competition to work. If there is only a single monopolist or if entrance to the market is expensive then competition will not work as described. The beneficiary will be the owners of the single monopolist or the incumbent firm. Similarly, if the process relies on some factor of production that cannot be replicated, for example, land, then the beneficiary of the economic progress will be the landlords.

Imagine I am a landlord. Once I own some land with property on it, I can sit back and enjoy the flow of income, without having to work. This flow of income is rent. Rent goes up, as wages increase.if I own a big monopoly with no competition, I can also own a permanent flow of profits that competition will not touch.

We term these two forms of property income 'generalised rent'. Generalised rent is a permanent flow of income associated with an asset that cannot be replicated. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies. We argue that generalised rent leads to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich.

So the limited things would be rationed by taxes rather than by private property, so that everyday people have a stake in the common resources and land doesn't become so expensive that individuals cannot afford their own homes.

## WICKED EXTERNALITIES

We haven't dealt with pollution. Usually, damaging other people or their interests (for example, through injury or theft) is illegal. But some economic activities which damage others are still legal. Driving a car, which pollutes the environment and could harm pedestrians if there is an accident, is legal and normal, but nevertheless, damaging to others' interests. Small, indirect damages from many independent sources can add up to a lot in total.

When one person or company's behaviour damages another we call this 'economic theft'. So for example, if I throw my plastic waste into the ocean, it can then damage fish and other marine life. My careless action has stolen from the future of the ocean.

What seems acceptable when societies are small may nevertheless be unacceptable when societies are larger. For example, Newfoundland fishermen could fish without constraints when their boats were small and their numbers low. There were plenty of fish. However, fish stocks are not unlimited. There is a limit on how many fish can be taken before it damages the fishery. If too many fish are taken, then the fish don't get a chance to reproduce, and the fish stocks collapse. This is what happened in Newfoundland. Fish used to be so plentiful that the sea teemed with life. But after the collapse in the fish stock, many fishermen went out of business.

The result of these economic effects is that we have too much pollution, not enough genuine wealth and economic growth that benefits the rich. 

Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without effective governance systems to constrain them. For the planet as a whole, this model is catastrophic. This book shows a route out of this economic situation. Growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. 

Economics needs to account for these external damage. Taxation should also correct the market, so those who damage the environment pay for the damage that they cause. Such a tax system would tax bad things, not good things. The physical use of natural resources should be taxed, and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged. So, with a proper tax system, the beautiful things that require care, like the natural environment, would be preserved. 

So we've seen that taxation seems to be important in our economic model because it sets the economic incentives for the private sector. This leads on to our next question.

# HOW TO MAKE THE CHANGE? PUBLIC POLITICAL ECONOMY (CHAPTER 4)

Our fourth question: how can we actually change the tax systems? Economists have been aware of rent and externalities for some time. Yet, taxes which would correct these economic distortions have only been imposed occasionally and partially. Why haven't corrective taxes been imposed?

Here we make the case for a simple 'change equation'. The perceived benefits must overwhelm the resistance. However, there is another problem. Nobody has made a sufficiently passionate and positive case for these taxes. This book aims to correct that.

One great milestone in the history of progress in the UK was the Beveridge report [-@Beveridge1942]. Seventy-five years ago, liberal economist William Beveridge presented his report for a new welfare state. It laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its objectives were to banish 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. Beveridge argued for universal benefits, as of right. This can be contrasted with the system of means testing that has since developed.

The Beveridge report shows a possible way forward for welfare. Before the second world war, the five social evils of Want, Squalor, Idleness, Disease and Ignorance ravaged the poor in Britain. The second world war destroyed many buildings, homes and businesses alike, and increased the government and external debt. But yet, the post war government managed to create a comprehensive welfare state where none existed before: a health service.

Three principles guided his report [@Beveridge1942: Part 1, paragraphs 6-9].

- *Radical*: From first principles, without fear or favour to social class or other interest groups.
- *Comprehensive*: Dealing with poverty, disease, bad housing, unemployment and a lack of education.
- *A liberal social contract*: No means testing and so no stifling of incentives; cooperation between the state, individuals and firms.

## PRINCIPLE 1: A FUNDAMENTAL REVIEW

First, he argued that World War II and its aftermath was 'a time for revolutions, not patching'. He offered a radical approach, informed by the experience of the past. He would not be restricted by the interests of one group or another. In short, his report would be *radical* (working from first principles) and prioritise the *common interest*.

We also aim to look at tax and welfare from first principles. We will then apply those first principles without fear or favour.

But are we at a revolutionary time? Can we change a complex system like tax and welfare from first principles, or is 'patching' the only realistic possibility? We will assert that change is possible if it is beneficial, fair and practical, and communicated well so that these aspects are evident.

One does not make fundamental progress without thinking about what a system should do and what it should be.

We also need to consider the motivation for, and the barriers to change. One barrier is the worry that some people will be made worse off by any changes. We need to ensure not only that the final state is fair but also that the transition between the current system and the new is also fair.

## PRINCIPLE 2: SOLVING GREAT EVILS

Second, he argued for a *comprehensive* solution to the five 'giant' social problems of the poor. His report dealt primarily with want (poverty) and disease (poor health). The other three 'giants' were ignorance (lack of education), squalor (poor housing), and idleness (unemployment). Accordingly, his report laid the basis not only for the UK's postwar welfare (or social security) system but also the National Health Service, public education, housing policy and a system of macroeconomic management aiming for full employment.

We still have Beveridge's giant social issues to some degree, but we are also faced with new problems. This book, like Beveridge's report, is devoted to five great societal challenges which face us now:

- *Widely-Spread Wealth*: Inequality of income and wealth, and especially that caused by arguably unfair means; tax avoidance and evasion; dominance of large mega-corporations with market power enriching the rich and wielding political power. Dealing with the challenge of increasing automation of work so that everyone has an adequate income and plenty of free time.
- *High Rent on Land and Resources*: Unaffordability of renting or purchasing homes, and the cost of importing fossil fuels.
- *Pollution and Other Environmental Damage*: Climate change, ocean acidification, plastics, over-fishing and habitat loss which all threaten the future.
- *Debt and Economic Imbalance*: Re-balancing the economy away from borrowing and asset inflation, and towards balanced growth and wealth formation.
- *Tax Evasion and Avoidance*: Can a tax system be designed that is simple and yet difficult to avoid?

We need to be passionate about the benefits that reform will bring. We consider these in the next section.

## PRINCIPLE 3: A SOCIAL CONTRACT ALIGNING REWARD AND CONTRIBUTION

Our new welfare system should not disincentivise work and should encourage service and contribution. We will study in detail Beveridge's third principle to see if, and how, a better welfare system can be created.

This involves the *integration* of the tax system with the benefits system so there is not a separate system of 'means testing'. This function can be carried out through the tax system. This suggests the case for a system with a universal component: we call this a 'citizen's dividend' (a form of basic income). Furthermore, we argue for an integrated skills training and work experience system. These two proposals are outlined later.

There's an overarching concept too, which we term policy entrepreneurship. That is, we should break out of the monopoly of thought imposed on us by neoclassical economics and neoliberal economic ideas. These forms of entrepreneurship imply a new growth model for everyone, one that is not based on increasing financialisation and debt issued on limited assets but rather the development of productive industries solving our collective problems. We deal with the potential benefits of our proposals in the next section.



## PRINCIPLE 4: MINIMISING RESISTANCE TO CHANGE

To Beveridge we add our own fourth principle, that the proposed changes should be prioritised: maximising the benefit and minimising the resistance

Resistance to taxes is associated with concentrated losses on specific groups. These groups can easily mobilise to resist new taxes. We can talk about two salient group: poor people and companies. Let's focus now on corporate lobbying. Companies can target their own financial interest in just a 

But taxes change the nature of what activities are profitable. So taxes, which could change the nature of these agents (for example, converting an oil company to a renewables producer) cannot be imposed because the very same agents resist the taxes as they oppose their interests. But these interests would change if the nature of the company was to change from oil to renewables. So we a have catch-22 situation. We can't change the companies without the tax. But we can't impose the tax without changing the company, since they resist politically. Instead, we need forms of tax that don't face such resistance but which lead to the transformation of companies in a positive direction.

# HOW CAN WE DEFINE A BETTER TAX AND WELFARE SYSTEM? (CHAPTER 5)

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. this book is devoted to how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent', and international flows of money and assets. 

But this book isn't really about government.

Rather it is about the use the taxation system to ensure that the *private sector* has the right incentives. So there are two, distinct, systems that are in scope of our book. The first is the entire private sector. his book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. If the private sector does not have the right incentives, it will not produce the right outcomes. Therefore, it is a book about economics. If the private sector is not to harm our general well being, then an effective tax system needs to be in place.

We wish not just to minimise the costs of taxation, but rather to aim for taxes, where possible, that are actively beneficial. Good taxes would shape the profit motive towards the needs of people, communities, and the living planet on which we all depend. Here, we seek a tax and social security system that is not only fair and practical but also beneficial to everyday people, our country and our world. 

The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems.

# TAX IN PRACTICE: AVOIDING AVOIDANCE AND EVADING EVASION (CHAPTER 6)

One further challenge is taxation in the context of international flows of income and money. It would be nice to tax unearned wealth accumulation as well as poor everyday people.

One key challenge to taxation is working out a means of taxation that can tax wealth and flows of income across international boundaries. International tax avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep.

Generally, the issue is as follows: One cannot (it is said) tax big companies or rich individuals because they will simply move their money abroad. Furthermore, we might even wish to reduce our taxes on companies to encourage them to locate in our country. This is problematic because it tends to lead to companies paying less and less tax.

Such a challenge also applies to the taxation of fossil fuels. If we tax emissions that are produced in the UK, this might encourage UK-based producers to move outside the UK. If instead, consumption of carbon-intensive goods is taxed, imports of goods produced abroad would be in scope, but exports would not. This would be helpful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would give a true picture of the emissions that a country is responsible for due to its consumption behaviour. Secondly, it creates a true incentive for exporting countries to decarbonise their economy. Thirdly, it encourages production processes to be improved, rather than simply relocated abroad.

Taxation of wealth also faces similar issues. Taxation theory aims to identify a base of taxation that is unresponsive to the tax. So in taxing wealth, we could argue for taxation of assets rather than taxation of wealthy individuals. Land is a straightforward asset to tax in this way. Land cannot just move out of the country.

Taxing corporate wealth is more difficult because a corporation is a more fluid and mobile than land. In this book, we suggest two radical strategies.

The first approach is the taxation of profits calculated as UK sales minus UK costs. This approach encourages companies to locate their costs in the UK. The higher the tax rate, the more operations would be moved to a UK base.

The second approach is an apportionment of multinational wealth based on where the sales of the companies are located.

Thus both for environmental damage and for wealth, we use consumption as a relatively fixed tax base.

# WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WOULD IMPLEMNTING OUR PRINCIPLES BRING? FOUR FORMS OF WEALTH


So what improvements could such proposals make? We argue that they could enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet. There are four crucial benefits of a better taxation system to wider society. We call these the four realms of value: households, communities, nations and the world.

The first skill based personal and social entrepreneurship.The second issue is state capitalism entrepreneurship. This involves both the state and capitalists. The third is municipal land value entrepreneurship, as has been seen in Singapore and Hong Kong. Finally we can suggest public good entrepreneurship: we suggest that the private sector be turned over to public good provision. The obvious example is green entrepreneurship, but we also suggest ways that companies can tackle other global issues such as the lack of good antibiotics.

## IMPROVEMENT 1: SECURE INCOMES, PRODUCTIVE JOBS AND ECONOMIC POWER (CHAPTERS 7 and 8)

The current social security system is highly insecure: benefits are taken away from people when their conditions change, leading them often to go into arrears with their rent or other payments, and often leading them into debt. The current social security system also discourages work, as benefits are withdrawn as income increases (in the Universal Credit system at a rate of 61% for every £ increase in income). A better system in which benefit would not be withdrawn so rapidly as income increases, would encourage people to increase their skill level, would be well integrated with the taxation system and would also support those who enhance their communities in ways other than simply earning money (for example, by caring or raising a child). It would also allow division of labour with minimal taxation between individuals in communities (so eliminating the tax advantages of being a company relative to an everyday citizen).

To achieve this improvement, we need to simplify the existing income and means-tested benefit system. Rather than the current system of means testing benefits, there would be a single system of basic income and taxation. A 'simplifying' basic income payable to everyone in society would be combined with a simplification of the system of income taxation, so that a standard rate of 40% is applied to all income up to the point when someone reaches the top 1% of incomes. Furthermore, there would be citizen wealth funds, and assets would be granted to individuals based on how much tax they paid. There would be a 'target minimum level' of wealth and individual's tax would build up this minimum level of wealth. We have a SIMPLIFIED INCOME TAX, BASIC INCOME and WEALTH FUND.

**Case Study: Income and Corporation Tax: USA in the period 1945--1980**

The United States in the post war showed the advantage of redistributive income taxation, including high tax rates on companies. The top rate of income tax was often over 70% in that period, and taxes on companies were also higher than at present. Because everyone's incomes were not widely different, this meant that normal people could not only afford consumer goods but also everyone had a chance to buy the limited positional goods such as land. Since the top rate of tax was high, and since income tax is the largest and most important tax, this meant that the average tax rate paid by people on average earnings was lower. We discuss this is parts 6 and 7.

## IMPROVEMENT 2: AN AFFORDABLE HOME IN A PROSPEROUS COMMUNITY (CHAPTER 8)

Achieving economic security for all. The second priority is an affordable home for all. British governments have massively mismanaged the taxation of housing and business properties. By appropriately taxing the value of the location (land), in a way that is convenient and fair for all, we make it possible for most people to enjoy the economic benefits of owning their own home. An optimal tax system would encourage community action, so that 'community entrepreneurship' allows communities to develop their value and capture the fruits of this development. How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England?

Well, the first thing is to capture location rent increases for public causes. What does this mean? This means that the property taxes: council taxes, business rates and stamp duty should be rolled up into a single tax. This should be a tax on property with the *value* of tangible investment deductible. So that means a house is a value, so you shouldn't be charged on this. The residual should be allocated between the local community, the municipal authority and the central government. Taxing property values rather than property per se would stabilise the current property values. We have a LAND VALUE TAX payable in cash or deferred until sale or death.

**Case Study: Land Value Capture in Singapore and Hong Kong since independence**

Singapore shows what has been termed the 'property state' [@Haila2015]: it shows what is possible when there is a 'prosperity loop' between investment in public infrastructure and public rent collection. In short, as the government makes infrastructure improvements, those increase the rental value of the land, and those land value increases then accrue to the government. Hong Kong also shows the advantages of this approach: before a new metro line is built, land near the new stations is purchased at pre-announcement cost and so society captures the land value benefit of the new infrastructure [Purves]. We discuss this is part 8.

## IMPROVEMENT 3: A PROSPEROUS AND WEALTHY COUNTRY (CHAPTER 09 and 10)

The second priority is a prosperous and wealthy country. The current taxation system does not encourage productive wealth formation. In fact, it encourages those sorts of companies that *extract* wealth from the country and discourages those who wish to invest in the society. A better system would encourage people who invest in *real assets*, but discourage purely financial investment. In short, a good tax system encourages a balance of trade. It discourages foreign investment in a financial sense whilst encouraging investment in a real sense. An optimal taxation system would involve a collaboration between state and the private sector, so the gains of research and development investment are shared between both. And an optimal social security system would involve some funding from sovereign wealth funds, including personal accounts, so that the people and state accumulate assets to support them in hard times.

For this, we need to provide an incentive for companies like Dyson to locate into the UK. We suggest the following: a *higher* corporate tax but calculated as follows: Sales -- UK Wages -- UK Investment. In other words, the tax should *encourage* UK companies to invest in the UK. We call this a DYSON TAX. The financial system should be encouraged to lend to real businesses.

**Case Study: Financial 'Repression' in the UK in the period 1945 -- 1980**

One great anxiety is about *debt*. There are basically two forms of debt that concern people: public (or government) debt and private debt. High public debt pressures governments to 'cut the deficit' through 'austerity'. Yet in the past, the best way to reduce the burden of public debt has been not to worry about it: or rather to use different strategies. In the three decades after the second world war, the UK reduced its public debt to GDP ratio from over 250% of GDP to 70% of GDP. It did this not through austerity, but rather through growth, inflation, monetisation of some debt, and low interest rates. We consider the fiscal benefits of such strategies later in this book.



## IMPROVEMENT 4: A CLEAN AND SAFE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT (CHAPTER 12)

The final priority is the environment. We start with the most important part of the tax system, the system of environmental taxation. There are a number of major environmental problems facing us, most notably climate change and ocean acidification, but also including the prevalence of plastics in the ocean, habitat destruction, road congestion, over-fishing, rare resource consumption and conventional air, water and land pollution. Using environmental taxes faces a few challenges: they can be unpopular, hard to design, encourage 'off-shoring' of dirty forms of manufacture and bureaucratic. Finally, because sometimes demand for damaging products can be unresponsive to price, a high environmental tax may be necessary. But high environmental taxes may be unpopular, disruptive or unrealistic. Also, individual country actions are not enough. Instead, we need action that is global. But there are no functioning global institutions. Thus, we look for solutions that can be implemented at a national level, which *and* which encourage other countries to follow the lead. Such solutions should be within international laws and rules as well. We show how those potential issues can be overcome.

Because it is so important, the main priority is not to raise additional revenue with this taxation source, but we do intend to ensure that the private sector has the correct incentives. To accomplish that, we start with a higher carbon tax on electricity production. Electricity production should have an incentive to be carbon neutral. We achieve this with a tax on carbon inputs with a subsidy on electricity production. Simultaneously, we also provide low-cost loans from the public loan board. There will be prizes for rapid roll-out of new technologies and national targets for the roll out of low-carbon electricity. We have a CARBON TAX.

**Case Study: Environmental Taxes in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the UK**

Three European countries show that a carbon tax can work exactly as planned. Sweden, Switzerland and the UK all have a carbon tax. Sweden was one of the first to introduce its carbon tax and the per capita  emissions of Sweden are now among the lowest in Europe. Similarly, Switzerland has also introduced such a tax. The UK introduced its carbon price floor more recently, and it has seen a large fall in emissions. Most notably, we have seen a drop in the use of coal in electricity generation. Other environmental taxes include charges for plastic bags.



## SUMMARY OF Proposals (CHAPTER 14)

We will set out how, on a consumption basis, *taxing* the environmental damage that people cause is sensible, that we should tax unproductive and unearned wealth, and finally, we should tax luxury consumption using the income tax system to ensure it is progressive.

We also have some reforms for the benefits and training system. We suggest a dividend for everyone, a cheque in the post -- and to integrate the tax and benefits system, replacing means testing with taxation (since it achieves the same thing, taking money away from people as they earn more). We also suggest an active benefits system for training people in high skills. We suggest the accumulation of wealth across the poor, rather than the government having the responsibility to support them. Then, when people pay their tax, some of that tax would be set aside as a contribution that will fund the purchase of assets, a return to a contributory tax system.

Finally, we suggest changes to the financial system. Allied to our tax on wealth is a tax on lending on unproductive wealth. Thus, we encourage investment across the economy. We use the financial system to actively promote the capture of land rent for public purposes. We suggest particularly low-cost loans for the building a new cost infrastructure, in this country and around the world. Finance is particularly international and lending can ensure that everyone gets enough energy.
