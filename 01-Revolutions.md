# PART 2: TAX AND WELFARE IN HISTORY

# 2-1: Revolutions in the Minds of Men

UNDER THE STARRY SKIES, far away from the everyday hustling and bustling of the commercial metropolis, sits a professor, beavering away at his manuscript. The year is 1773; the location, Kirkaldy, a small town in Scotland; the author, Adam Smith. The full title of Smith's great work would be 'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'.

On this cool and starry night, Smith was writing the fifth and final book of the 'Wealth of Nations', entitled 'On the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth'. Smith asked, 'how should the activity of the government be funded?'. Which taxes should a state impose?

This book is devoted to similar questions: how should we fund the state? Which taxes should be levied and why? And relatedly, what would make a better welfare system? We use taxation and welfare firstly as tools to  enhance the wealth of the planet, of nations, of communities and of individuals. By wealth, we mean the stock of valuable things, including the environment and individuals. And we are concerned also to distribute wealth fairly, partly by ensuring that wealth does not beget more wealth unless it is productively invested, and partly by ensuring that the transition to a fairer system is itself fair to all. Our immediate scope is the UK, but our ideas could be applied anywhere. 

So let's get back to our story. Tax is not just a matter of theoretical interest but has also been a driver of history.  If Smith's book contributed to a revolution of ideas, in other parts of the world a more hot and imminent political revolution was brewing.

WHILST SMITH WORKED by candlelight, far across the oceans, in what was then the British colony of North America, some demonstrators were heaping tea into the sea. The demonstrators' objection: the British state was collecting taxation without giving them representation in the British parliament. Adam Smith himself agreed with the American revolutionaries that the North American colonies should be represented in the British parliament in proportion to the tax they paid. From this dispute, the American Revolution was born. 

Revolution was also brewing in France. [In 16xx], Jean-Baptist Colbert, minister of Finance to the King of France, had said that 'The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of squawking.' In France, one of the first economists, Francois Quesnay, had argued for a single tax on the value of land to replace all other taxes. The tax never happened, indeed Adam Smith commented both on its economic benefit and its political challenges when he said, with dry irony 'The single tax on land is the tax that does not threaten to discourage industry anywhere' [Check Quote]. By 1789, the geese had not only squawked, they had overthrown the farmer and taken control of the farm. The French Revolution had arrived. 

## From Rural to Urban Land

Let's take our magic carpet to cross the Atlantic and forward a century in time. A journalist in San Francisco is learning his craft. He is fascinated by a subject which was then still called 'political economy'. He was interested in one question in particular: why was there so much poverty in the midst of so much technological progress? The journalist noted that it was in the biggest, most advanced cities, with the most technological advancement, which also had the worst, most grinding, poverty. His name was Henry George and his book was called *Progress and Poverty*. It became a bestseller, outselling all books in the 1870s apart from the bible. Yet, Henry George is largely forgotten today.

George's work echoed the more turgid prose of banker and great economic theorist David Ricardo. Ricardo had argued that an agricultural landlord contributed nothing to the well-being of society: he merely extracted the surplus from the land once the costs of labour and tools had been paid. This surplus is known as rent. As had been previously argued by Adam Smith, the best tax, therefore, was a tax on rent. Whilst Ricardo modelled a rural economy, Henry George was concerned with urban land. The ownership of urban land allowed the landowners to benefit as society developed, whilst contributing nothing to the increase in land values. George popularised the message that the remedy was to tax urban landlords. He used beautiful words that everyday folk could understand. [Quote now?] 

Inspired by Henry George, a woman by the name of Elizabeth Magie invented a board game called the *Landlords' Game*. The game illustrated that without a tax on urban land, property tended to get monopolized and those who owned it extracted rent from those who did not. If, however, landowners were taxed, then a stable and fair (if rather boring) outcome ensued. Later, the game was shorn of the beneficial, but boring, rules, leaving only the case where an unstable and unfair (if at times fun) ruleset remained. Therefore, the original political implications of the game name were lost and the new game was marketed as 'Monopoly'. The goal of Monopoly is to own the whole board and to drive all the other players bankrupt. This might make an exciting game but it was far from a system of widely-spread prosperity. The case for a land value tax is considered later in this book.

## War and Progress

Henry George inspired many of his readers, including the young Winston Churchill and British prime minister David Lloyd George. Towards the end of the First World War, there was even a budget which implemented a Land Value Tax, the 'People's Budget'. But due to the resistance of landowners and the difficulties of valuation, the budget was never implemented. Nevertheless, from the late nineteenth century through the whole of the twentieth century, and particularly after the Second World War, the conditions of the poor improved. The curse of slum landlords and destitution was almost banished.

One great milestone in this history of progress was the Beveridge report. Released in 1942 and chaired by Liberal economist Lord Beveridge, it laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its aim was to banish the five great evils: 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness' [Check quote]. After the war, Beveridge's report inspired a social security system, public education, public housing, a national health service and macroeconomic management aimed at ensuring full employment. 

These reforms helped to reduce the prevalence of the five great evils and transformed the previously hellish conditions of the poor. But we have not achieved heaven on earth. There are still great evils facing us: the destruction of the environment, the lack of affordable housing in many towns, great inequalities of wealth, and the risks of automation. This book will explain why these evils arise and how they can be fixed.

## The Global Machine and the Global Mission

We are now in the present day. The subject then called political economy is now called economics. Great container ships cross the oceans. Aircraft zig-zag the skies. Massive machines in far-off lands churn out phones, which everyone is looking at. Many people live with more consumer comforts than in the past. Some things are cheap: it is relatively cheap to fly off to sun-kissed beaches on foreign shores. But some things are very expensive: it is expensive to buy a flat in London for example. 

This great machinery of commerce is devoted to two purposes: to give people what they desire (or at least, what they can be encouraged to buy), and to make a profit in so doing. The commercial machine is in many ways smooth. But there are rumblings of discontent. In 1848, the 'spectre of communism' overshadowed the world, according to Marx. Today, the danger of environmental destruction, runaway technology and a state run by and for the superrich to enrich themselves still further, overshadows this machine for happy fulfilment of our consumer desires.

In America, a man promises to 'drain the swamp'. This man later would become president. It would be natural to take these words to mean that the army of smart-suited lobbyists, that aim to direct the ship of state to favour their interests, would be sent packing. Nothing of the sort happened. Indeed, the swamp got ever marshier. The poor, who had seen nothing much of forty years of economic growth in the US were increasingly addicted to prescription painkillers. In the United Kingdom and the United States, people stopped living longer.

This was by now a truly global civilisation. And scientists were warning that something truly global was wrong. In a conference room, a group of scientists called for radical shifts to stop burning fossil fuels in a couple of decades. The great machinery of commerce, which had since the end of the Second World War been devoted to giving us more and more stuff, would need to be turned around to a new purpose.  
To turn around this great global machine -- this supertanker of consumer commerce -- we need to apply not only the great resources of the state but also the dynamism and capacity of the private sector. We need to harness the profit motive for the good of the planet. And for that, we need to tax the damages that individuals and companies cause to the living planet. In this book, we seek to use the tax system to do so, not only by changing the incentives of the private sector in one country, but also by ensuring that other countries have a reason to follow that lead. 

The reforms that we are proposing will transform the prospects of early adopter countries so that others will have no choice but to follow that lead.


## The Prices of Flats and of Flights

It's now a wet November evening. Let me introduce Peter and his wife, Lucy, who are shivering in their North London flat, pressing refresh on their email program and looking at their phones. They are waiting to see whether their offer has been accepted on a two-bedroom flat in a rundown neighbourhood of the city.

An advert flicks up for a getaway flight to somewhere sunnier. If they can take the time off, then they can get away to a nice sunny island for a week. The small flat they are purchasing is, by normal standards, inordinately expensive. They will be paying off their mortgage until they reach retirement age. But the flight is cheap: they can book it for less than one day's wages each.

To Peter and Lucy this is the usual way of things, although they don't like it much. Their friend Mel pointed out to them that the world is running out of time to tackle one of the major environmental problems facing it, climate change. Lucy feels a certain amount of guilt in the back of her mind for taking a holiday and the associated carbon emissions but is convinced by the low cost of the flights. When buying a roof over their heads is so expensive and so stressful, any normal person would need a little relief. They book the flight.


This book is about the prices of things, and how the prices of things is influenced by the taxation system. Houses and flights already have some taxes on them. If you live in a house, you pay Council Tax. And if you take a flight, you pay Air Passenger Duty. Putting a higher tax on houses will *reduce* the purchase price of the house. That's because the value of the house depends in part on the obligations associated with it, taxation included. 

This book does not argue for environmental taxes primarily to change the behaviour of consumers. Rather, it seeks to change the economy to provide goods in ways that do not damage the living planet. Sometimes, this will be difficult. It's hard to design aeroplanes that do not burn oil products. But technological change adapts to market need. And if zero-carbon planes cannot be designed, then perhaps those who fly should pay for the capture of Carbon Dioxide from the air elsewhere. The tax on flying, and other activities that produce greenhouse gases, should be enough to encourage people to capture those gases from the air if they cannot be eliminated directly.

The price of things needs to be just. A just price of things requires a just tax system. A just tax system will cause people to pay for the damage they cause to the environment. A just system will also ensure that nobody gets rich merely by owning some of the limited things of life, such as land. In short, justice and social benefit are the same, fairness and efficiency merely two sides of a coin. That is Tax Heaven. It is to such a tax system that this book is devoted.  

There's a corny old joke about the man that asks for directions and gets the response "Well, if I was going there, I wouldn't start from here". It's not just the final state of affairs that must be just, but also the approach of getting from here to there. In the later parts of the book, we show how to transition in a fair way to a just tax system.

# 2-2: Beveridge and The Social Contract

Further down the street from Peter and Lucy lives Fred. Fred is on benefits. He once took a job, but he found that once this happened, his benefits were cut off. There was a gap between his new wage and the benefits coming in. Thanks to this, he didn't have the money for the rent. 

The UK has rolled out a reform known as 'Universal Credit', which integrates four income-related benefits into one. The 'benefits withdrawal' rate (in effect the income tax on additional income) on Universal Credit is 63%. This means that you  lose two thirds of the extra income you get. [Some of the problems with the new system include a delay in payment of benefits whilst administration takes place.] [*** Add to this later]

It does not have to be this way. One great milestone in the history of progress in the UK was the Beveridge report  [-@Beveridge1942]. Seventy-five years ago, liberal economist William Beveridge presented his report for a new welfare state. It laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its objectives were to banish 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. Beveridge argued for universal benefits, as of right. This can be contrasted with the system of means testing that has since developed. Three principles guided his report [@Beveridge1942: Part 1, paragraphs 6-9].

First, he argued that World War II and its aftermath was 'a time for revolutions, not patching'. He offered a radical approach, informed by the experience of the past. He would not be restricted by the interests of one group or another. In short, his report would be *radical* (working from first principles) and prioritise the *common interest*.

Second, he argued for a *comprehensive* solution to the five 'giant' social problems of the poor. His report dealt primarily with want (poverty) and disease (poor health). The other three 'giants' were ignorance (lack of education), squalor (poor housing), and idleness (unemployment). Accordingly, his report laid the basis not only for the UK's postwar welfare (or social security) system but also the National Health Service, public education, housing policy and a system of macroeconomic management aiming for full employment. 

Finally, Beveridge argued that there should be reward for contribution and service. The social contract of the mixed economy involves *cooperation* between the State and the individual. The welfare system should not stifle incentive, opportunity or responsibility. It would be an insurance system. It would involve a social contract of *giving* in return for *subsistence* benefits as a *right*, *without* means-testing. The state would offer the security of a subsistence standard of living in exchange for *service* and *contribution*. Welfare benefits would not preclude individuals from being employed or self-employed. Benefits would not be withdrawn as people earned more. The outcome has been very different from what Beveridge intended.

In summary, the Beveridge principles are as follows:

- *Radical*: From first principles, without fear or favour to social class or other interest groups.
- *Comprehensive*: Dealing with poverty, disease, bad housing, unemployment and a lack of education.
- *A liberal social contract*: No means testing and so no stifling of incentives; cooperation between the state, individuals and firms.

World War II had almost bankrupted Britain. Britain had financed the war through borrowing. The public debt ratio peaked at 238% of GDP in 1947. Despite this, post war Britain soon rebuilt itself. It also managed to provide for its people a standard of living greater than before the war. Britain pursued a policy of low interest rates, moderate inflation and high growth. Thus, it cut the burden of public debt to 70% of GDP in 30 years. [Ref: IMF WEO Paper?]

These accomplishments are in themselves remarkable. We will explain in more detail later.

Beveridge was  successful in his mission to lay the foundation for a comprehensive welfare state. Yet, some of his principles, especially the third, were unevenly applied. 

## Principle 1: A Fundamental Review

We also aim to look at tax and welfare from first principles. We will then apply those first principles without fear or favour.

But are we at a revolutionary time? Can we change a complex system like tax and welfare from first principles, or is 'patching' the only realistic possibility? We will assert that change is possible if it is beneficial, fair and practical, and communicated well so that these aspects are evident.

One does not make fundamental progress without thinking about what a system should do and what it should be. 

We also need to consider the motivation for, and the barriers to change. One barrier is the worry that some people will be made worse off by any changes. We need to ensure not only that the final state is fair but also that the transition between the current system and the new is also fair.

## Principle 2: The New Five Great Challenges

We still have Beveridge's giant social issues to some degree, but we are also faced with new problems. This book, like Beveridge's report, is devoted to five great societal challenges which face us now:

- *Widely-Spread Wealth*: Inequality of income and wealth, and especially that caused by arguably unfair means; tax avoidance and evasion; dominance of large mega-corporations with market power enriching the rich and wielding political power. Dealing with the challenge of increasing automation of work so that everyone has an adequate income and plenty of free time.
- *High Rent on Land and Resources*: Unaffordability of renting or purchasing homes, and the cost of importing fossil fuels.
- *Pollution and Other Environmental Damage*: Climate change, ocean acidification, plastics, overfishing and habitat loss which all threaten the future.
- *Debt and Economic Imbalance*: Rebalancing the economy away from borrowing and asset inflation, and towards balanced growth and wealth formation.
- *Tax Evasion and Avoidance*: Can a tax system be designed that is simple and yet difficult to avoid?

## Principle 3: A Social Contract Aligning Reward and Contribution

Our new welfare system should not disincentivise work and should encourage service and contribution. We will study in detail Beveridge's third principle to see if, and how, a better welfare system can be created. 

This involves the *integration* of the tax system with the benefits system so there is not a separate system of 'means testing'.  This function can be carried out through the tax system. This suggests the case for a system with a universal component: we call this a 'citizen's dividend' (a form of basic income). Furthermore, we argue for an integrated skills training and work experience system. These two proposals are outlined later.
