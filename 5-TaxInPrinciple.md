# PART 5: TAX IN PRINCIPLE: ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS

# 5-1 Great Economists on Taxation

So how should we apply economics to tax? Many economists have considered what an ideal tax system should look like and much has been written about how practically to implement these principles. Adam Smith is perhaps the most famous economist of them all. Smith's four axioms of taxation are that taxes should be convenient, objective, low cost both in terms of direct costs and the discouragement the cause to others, proportional to ability to pay. Smith [-@smith1776wealth, Book V, Chapter I] argued that:

> "Good taxes meet four major criteria. They are (1) proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay (2) certain rather than arbitrary (3) payable at times and in ways convenient to the taxpayers and (4) cheap to administer and collect."

We consider these canons of tax further in part 5 of this book. A tax on land rents is mentioned by Smith as amongst the optimal tax:

> "Both ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of revenue which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of the state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of industry. The annual produce of the land and labour of the society, the real wealth of the great body of the people, might be the same after such a tax as before. Ground rents and the ordinary rent of land are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax upon them"

David Ricardo [-@ricardo1821principles], Henry George [-@George1879], John Stewart Mill [-@mill1848principles], and Alfred Marshall [-@marshall1890principles] have also argued for the advantages of taxing land rent. Frank Ramsey [-@Ramsey1927] extended the argument to commodities in general, developing a formula for optimal taxation such that those commodities most inelastic in supply or in demand should be taxed the most. 

Meanwhile Arthur Cecil Pigou [-@Pigou1924] developed the idea of taxing externalities - situations, as pollution, when an economic activity damages others not involved in a transaction. Keynes's Polish contemporary Kalecki argued that taxation of wealth would increase effective demand and therefore economic growth without stifling incentives [@Kalecki1937]. And more recently Piketty [-@Piketty2014a] has shown the consequences for the growth in inequality if wealth and high income are not sufficiently taxed.

There have also been a number of comprehensive reports into practical taxation. In the UK there was the Meade Review into direct taxation [@Meade1977] and the Mirrlees Review into taxation in general [@Mirrlees2010d], [@Mirrlees2011]. There have also been similar reviews in Canada [@Carter1966], the United States [@Bradford1977] and, more recently, in Australia [@Henry2010] and New Zealand [@evans2011reflections].

Standing on the shoulders of these giants, we argue for two general principles. First, that the allocation of capital needs to account for costs and benefits to society as a whole, rather than just private profit within the system of property rights that we have at present. Second, that the ownership of assets and the return from the ownership of assets needs to be distributed widely. 

Turning more specifically to tax, economists would say that we should tax *externalities* and *economic rent*. In simple language, if an individual or company pollutes the environment, they should be prosecuted or should pay a tax. Landlords put up rent as wages grow and should also be subject to higher taxation. Finally, as companies get bigger and bigger, they often can set high prices and cut costs at the same time, buying up or forcing out the competition and gaining market power at the cost of everyday people. This is a further possible base for tax.

# 5-2 A Tripartite Framework for Taxes

What are taxes really for? What makes a good tax system? Is there such a thing? These questions remain unexplored for many people for whom taxes are just an inevitability, a necessary evil, and a yearly burden. As the old saying goes - there is nothing so certain in life as death and taxes.

There are those, of course, for whom the very concept of tax raises strong passions. Staunch libertarians claim that taxation is the blatant theft of private property, while social democrats often consider taxation to be a moral matter in the redressing of the unfairness of the free market. Emotions can therefore run high in debates on the purposes of taxation, and there often appears to be little common ground. This can make discussions of the philosophical basis of taxation somewhat difficult. But it is into this fraught debate that we are attempting to venture, with a hope to outline principles on which all (or most) will agree.

So if we assume, for now, that taxes are a necessary evil, then we must establish some guiding principles on how they should be applied. As our starting point, we have chosen three core characteristics which we suggest that all and every tax should possess. Taxes should be *beneficial*, *practical* and *fair*.

**Beneficial (Not Harmful)**

To be beneficial is to do good overall. There are multiple ways in which different taxes might be said to 'do good', and people may fairly disagree on what 'good' means. However all taxes must have some legitimate claim to be beneficial. Most would agree that a tax is beneficial if it pays for valued public services. For example, taxation that pays for our National Health Service, our emergency services, our roads, schools and public transport, is generally considered necessary and beneficial. This is evidenced by a recent survey of British citizens [@PWC2017] which found that the majority would be willing to pay more tax if it lead to improvements in the quality of the NHS. 

More contentiously, taxation may be said to be doing good by redistributing income (or at least ensuring that the rich contribute more), helping to alleviate poverty, and reducing large wealth disparities. Tax may be used to ensure a minimum standard of living by providing an income 'safety net'. 

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behaviour by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage our natural environment, and health, by polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. So by taxing harm, it encourage companies to include these costs in their decision making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or investing to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such land. Of course, if tax is not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Instead the private sector, specifically, the existing owners will ration the resources through increasingly higher prices (rents), and in so doing provide unearned value or income to those who control them. Taxation can be used to fairly ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced, so that the country benefits as a whole.

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behaviour by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage the natural environment and health of all citizens by polluting the atmosphere on which we all depend. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. So by taxing harm, it encourage companies to include these costs in their decision-making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or by creating pools of investment to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such as land. Of course, if taxes are not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Lacking this, the private sector, specifically the existing ownership class, will ration these resources through increasingly higher rents, and as the rents go up, so will the sale price. In this way unearned income and capital gains will accrue to those who control the scarce resources. Taxation can be used to fairly ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced, so that the country benefits as a whole.

**Fair (Just)**

There are three ways in which we think taxes must be fair: consistency, progressivity, and justice in transition. 

The first is that they must be fair in the sense of being consistent. Identical persons, companies and situations should be treated identically. There should be no special exemptions or 'sweetheart deals' for favoured individuals or companies. As we shall see in the section on corporation tax, this principle can be flouted by particularly big or powerful companies.

Related to this idea of fairness are concepts of accountability and transparency. Taxes must not just be fair, but must be seen to be fair. Thus taxes should be clear and transparent, such that it is apparent to everyone what the proper tax burden should be for each income bracket. These issues are particularly topical in Britain today. In early 2017, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee expressed concern that HMRC's 'lack of transparency' concerning high net worth individuals 'has eroded public trust in a fair tax system' [@HoC2017].

Another, perhaps more controversial, kind of fairness concerns *progressivity*. A progressive tax is a tax in which those who have more, pay more. UK income tax is thus a progressive tax as richer citizens pay more proportionally than poorer citizens. We think that this is fair and thus we believe that taxes should be fair in the sense of being progressive. However, this viewpoint is not without controversy.

Fairness is also relevant to our discussion of economic rents and land values. When land values increase because of work performed by society as a whole by our definition it would be fair if all citizens benefit. It would seem unfair for only some people to benefit. Similarly, it would seem unfair if only a few people benefited from the country's natural resources - resources which were not created by any person, but which form part of the wealth of the nation as a whole. 

Finally, fairness is necessary in the transition from the existing system to the new system. This is necessary not only for reasons of justice, but also the political feasibility of the reforms: if they are seen as unfair to people here and now, they would be unpopular.

**Practical (Functions Smoothly)**

If a tax was fair and intended to do good, but couldn't be implemented without requiring masses of paperwork, or prohibitive costs, or extreme social controls, then no matter the benefit, it would not be justifiable. Taxes must be practical to implement. There are many aspects to practicality and we cover them here. When considering whether a tax is practical, we might consider how close it is to a theoretical ideal. 

Ideally, a tax should be simple to implement and administer. It also should have low collection and compliance costs. This means that it should not cost the government huge sums to collect, and it should also be very easy for taxpayers to comply with. The less paperwork, time-consuming research and confusing the rules involved, the better. Taxes which are automatically collected are more practical in this regard than those which require large amounts of form-filling and record-keeping. 

Another aspect of practicality is predictability. Individuals and companies must be able to predict future expenses in order to arrange financial matters. 

In a similar vein, taxes must be clearly defined so that taxpayers can plan their affairs while knowing exactly how much tax they can expect to pay. One example which has been a particularly hot topic in recent years concerns tax evasion. Tax avoidance is the *legal* dodging of tax; tax evasion is the *illegal* dodging of tax. It is clear that a tax which is easily evadable or avoidable will not be practical because it will not function to increase public funds, and may require significant resources to be wasted chasing up non-complying 'tax cheats'. 

# 5-3 Appendix: More detail

David Ricardo was one of the great economic theorists. To distribution of the economic pie he put together a model of different land qualities and their respective qualities and thus rents. He recommended a tax on landowners rent.

Henry George also recommended a tax on land rent. He extended Ricardo's reasoning to urban land. He noted that the speculators always would win, at the expense of everyday people.

**Tax theory**
Frank Ramsey, a mathematician and economic limits polymath, wrote a paper on commodity taxation. His paper argued for the inverse elasticity rule: the amount of taxation payable on a commodity would be proportional to the sum of the reciprocal of the demand and supply elasticity for that good.

Arthur Cecil Pigou argued for taxes on externalities; that is, when one actor affects another without paying the price.

After WW2, progressive income tax systems. Lord Beveridge argued for a 'cradle to grave' system of social welfare.

In 'how to pay for the war' Keynes argues for sone practical measures. In the end, he got his wish for the 'euthanasia of the renter', as startling bonds and money lost a lot of their real value as the massive national debt was deflated and grown away.

Keynes's contemporary polish economist Kalecki argues for a tax on 'capital' (wealth) on similar grounds. He argued it would be macroeconomically stimulating to the economy to do so.

More recently, Piketty argues for a wealth tax both to provide useful information on the wealth endowment of rich people and to reduce the inherent advantages that wealth brings.  

Great reviews of taxation and benefits 

From time to time there have been major studies on taxation reform commissioned by various governments or learned think tanks. The most famous was perhaps not one in tax at all but rather welfare: the Beveridge review.

But apart from that, there have been a number of reports. One is the Meade review into direct taxation.. it recommends a so called cash flow taxation system of taxing consumption. This idea has been followed up more recently in the contributors to the Mirrlees review.

The Mirrlees review recommended something on similar lines but less radical: a deduction for the normal cost of capital. It also recommended a land value tax to replace business rates, a proportional property tax to replace council tax and stamp duty,

There were also tax reviews in Canada and Australia and New Zealand.

In Canada, the review argued for income tax on the basis of discretionary economic power. This meant that Subsistence would not be taxed.

There have also be economists who have considered the utility basis of taxes: to what extent does income make is happy? Thornstein(???) Veblen notes the phenomenon of 'conspicuous consumption'. More recently, Fred Hirsch's 'the social limits to growth' indicated how many of the things we value are so called 'positional' goods: being the best ballerina for example. 

Robert Frank's 'the Darwin Economy' notes that utility inniological terms is often positional and relative. This he argues has strong implications for taxation: we should tax luxury consumption.

In terms of environmental taxation, many IPCC reports mention the need for a carbon price (either a tax or tradeable quotas). Fred Coase is often considered the intellectual progenitor of the notion of assigning 'property rights' to the right to emit pollution.

The Green Fiscal Commissiom in the UK has looked into in detail the possibilities for taxing environmental bads. In this it overlaps with the Mirlees review which called for effective carbon pricing and

The ExTax project in the Netherlands looked across extraction and pollution at the whole range of environmental and resource taxes. On the other hand 'Carbonomics' considers the resource rent impact of environmental taxes.

Land value tax has recently had a resurgence, with the publication of Rethinking the economics of land and property, and many reports by the New Economic Foundations and others.

Financial and Money taxes are also significant. 'Spiritual economics' argues for a tax on money balances, a sort of negative interest rate. In this he echoes the work of Silvio Gesell who argued for demurrage' on money, or 'stamp scrip'. Indeed this was implemented and proved a success in Worgl, Austria.

We might say there are four major contributions to optimal taxation, focused on land value taxation, commodities taxation, externalities taxation and optimal income taxation.

Going further back we might say that land value taxation is close to the Islamic tradition of the Zakat, whereas Optimal Income Taxation could be seen to reference the income tax system.

# 5-4: Why Tax?

This question is deceptively simple. In fact there are actually two questions. 

1. Why do we need to tax?
2. What justifies tax?

## Do We Need Tax?

Why Do We Tax? One of the first topics that one has to ask is why we should tax at all. 

The obvious answer to this is that we tax in order to make money for the government. But since the government can print and spend money if it chooses, this answer does not satisfy us. On the other hand if the government printed too much money this might cause inflation. So therefore it seems, indirectly, that the reason for taxing stuff is to control inflation, to maintain the value of the money that does exist in society. This is a theory. But for our purposes, it's the *difference* between tax and spending which we will assume could boost the economy or create inflation. It's not our purpose here to worry too much about that difference. 

When we says that 'Fred has a lot of money' we might mean one of two things. The first is that Fred is rich. He has houses, shares, businesses, fast cars. Actually he might not have much money at all, in the sense that his wallet might be empty and he might not have much in his current account. In technical terms we say we have assets.

The other meaning is more literal. We might need some cash for some reason. For example to pay a restaurant bill where they dont accept cards. In more technical terms we say that we have *liquid* assets. Liquid assets are assets we can use to buy stuff.

Well imagine two different strategies that the government can adopt. The first increases the wealth of the population, the second swaps some of the existing wealth for another form. It can be easily seen that it is likely that increasing his wealth is going to have a greater effect than increasing the amount of liquid assets ... unless he really is short of liquid assets.

The government can increase the quantity of assets in the economy by spending more than it receives in taxes. It can do this in two ways. The first way is simple: it can print money to pay for the difference between its spending and it's taxation. This increases the assets in the economy in a simple manner. There is simply more money in the economy.

In strict balance sheet terms, the government now has a liability and the private sector has an asset. It's not easy to see that banknotes are actually a government liability. For what are they liable? In fact they are liable for goods and services equal in value to the money outstanding. If the government sold something, say gold bars, this would be very easy to demonstrate. 

it would be easy to see that just like Tesco reward points are a liability to Tesco, because you can buy things in Tesco with them.

Thus we are going to assume, for now, that we need to raise tax in order to raise revenue for government. There are other ways of raising revenue for government; we are just going to assume that we need 

## What justifies tax? 

There are a lot of answers to that. We will cover some of them in our book: rent, externalities, discretionary economic power, ability to pay, compress consumption, ensure one group does not accumulate at the cost of another, protection services for asset owners.1

1.  The Need for Revenue: Governments need to tax for two reasons. Firstly they tax to fund ongoing public service, along the lines of Beveridge. Secondly they vary the balance between taxation and spending for macroeconomic reasons. The government needs the ability to influence to economy when the economy has broken down. 
2. Public Goods: If taxes fund public services. But it's important to note that taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. Talented individuals (scientists artists), everyday people in communities, institutions such as newspapers, charities, and companies all provide public goods.
3. The Social Contract: Taxes are one method for the enforcement of a social contract, a deal between and government and the people, where contribution is recognised.

4. Other reasons for taxes: Government has the choice about which taxes are imposed and what is taxes. Redistribution is one reason. Another reason for taxation is to correct for monopoly pricing and externalities. Generally if we look at the existing system, taxes tend to either have a redistributive purpose or a behaviour-changing purpose. Some taxes like VAT don't do much of either, but also have some advantages in terms of taxing.

## Our Assumptions

Assume we need publics services, we need tax. The amount of tax will vary. Our scope: how best to fund government; financial rights and obligations of corporate entities.

Strategic Tax Reform: We need a strategic long term principled approach

hareholder-stakeholder model? Who is the customer, who is the shareholder, who is the
The landlord at present is the shareholder in society. Rather he should be the customer, since the government provides. The people are currently the 'customer'. Actually they should be the shareholder, they should receive the dividends, once the common wealth has been built up.

## Objectives of Reform

`So what are our objectives)` for a reform of the tax and welfare system? Well, first, we have to reduce the risk of oligarchy.  What is oligarchy? It is 'rule by the few', specifically by the rich. And why is this a problem? Well, the problem is that when small groups of rich people have disproportionate influence in society, there is little that the rest of us can do. These groups could have a distortive influence on the tax code so that it better suits their interests. This would in turn be a problem for the majority.

Another area where the tax system could be used to benefit society is with the environment. Environmental taxes can help to ensure that the global environment is not damaged by our economic activities. Pollution is often considered a negative environmental externality. It's good for society to reduce these costs; taxing 'bads' helps to reduce them.

At present the current benefit system involves various 'benefit traps' and 'poverty traps'. A 'benefit trap' is a situation where it is better to stay on benefits than to take work, due to the perverse incentives built into the system. Because benefits are 'means- tested', when you gain work, you often lose equivalent benefits. Furthermore, poor people are often trapped in cycles of dependency. They have low skills and don't have the time and money to invest in themselves to improve matters. There may be children involved, in which case the high costs of childcare can be another factor. Drugs, abusive relationships, and crime can be other factors. When all of this is taken into account, it results in a dysfunctional benefit system that is confusing, unwieldy, unpredictable, and does not achieve its goal of supporting people into work. 



# 5-5: What could and should be taxed?

Taxes can be applied across a range of goods and services. We split these in to three: taxable assets, taxable transactions, and  taxable commodities. 

## Assets

- Land (residential, government, commercial, industrial, agricultural)
- Buildings (residential, government, commercial, industrial, agricultural)
- Money (cash and bank deposits)
- Companies (privately owned and shares in companies)
- Bonds (government and commercial companies's bonds)
- Capital goods such as machines, computers, etc.
- Infrastructure 
- Rights and permits e.g. patents
- Consumer durables including cars and house fittings etc.

## Transactions

- Wages
- Dividends
- Purchases
- Gifts
- Payments to suppliers
- Inheritance
- Purchase of assets e.g. houses and financial assets
- Physical investment
- Interest payments
- Compensation payments
- Transfers between bank accounts of the same person

## Physical Commodities

-  Pollution
-  Resources
-  Calorific Value / Food Composition

## Deciding What To Tax

But how do we decide what should be taxed? Which of these would fulfill the requirements of being beneficial, fair, and practical? To answer this, we must create a decision framework. 

1. Does private value reflect social value? If private value is greater than social value, increase tax until these two values are equivalent. 
2. If here is a need for more tax after taxing this value difference, tax things that are fixed in supply. This will mean that the tax does not have an effect of reducing real wealth. 
3. Transitioning to this system should preserve justice i.e. future increases in private value above social value should be taxed, while maintaining existing asset values where possible.

These taxes could be applied to a range of areas. For example, taxes could be applied to financial surpluses (e.g.(net) imports, profits, incomes over some threshold), and luxury expenditures whose demand is insensitive to price. Such taxes could help redistribute some or all of the surplus of those individuals, companies or geographical areas who are gaining financial assets.  

Taxes could also be applied to the unearned increment on scarce resources that are fixed or limited in supply, or monopolised e.g. land, fossil fuels and endangered fish.

Taxes could also help disincentivise environmental and health bads. These are activities that damage our common space (e.g. fossil fuels, other pollution, road congestion, ugly buildings)

# 5-6 Principles of a Reformed System
Taxes and benefits create incentives for good or ill. It's vital that these incentives are well-aligned with the interests of society as a whole. An improved tax and welfare system should be guided by economic, social and environmental objectives.

In the **short term**, we want a tax and welfare system that helps to create sufficient economic demand to ensure there are jobs for all who need them. There is no need for involuntary unemployment.

In the **medium term** , we wish to minimise the distortion caused by the tax system. The intention is to reduce or eliminate the losses of economic welfare caused by taxation and benefits. Private agents should pay the full costs of their behaviour. Where this behaviour impacts others negatively, a tax should be levied if that is practical.

In the **long term** , we need a tax system that encourages the UK to accumulate wealth ^[This term is defined in the main book.]. At the same time it should discourage destruction of natural wealth both in the UK and worldwide.

A well designed system would reconcile these competing objectives with the minimum of compromise. It could satisfy political objectives by demonstrating economic success and long term purpose. It would be very difficult to avoid, evade or 'game'. It would also not be susceptible to an international 'race to the bottom' where countries compete to reduce tax rates on companies and the super-rich.

An improved tax and welfare system would promote a wealthy society with a high quality of life. Hong Kong's system demonstrates the advantages of a simple tax system (although congestion, pollution and inequality remain of concern there). Germany, Switzerland, Singapore and the Nordic countries are rich countries we might wish to study and possibly emulate.

We must now assess particular taxes and benefits. First, we define the functions and desirable characteristics (non-functional requirements) of the tax-welfare system. We then sketch out options (taxes and benefits). We then assess these taxes according to the requirements. Our shortlist contains the taxes and benefits that score highest. Finally we select from the short list the taxes and benefits which together fulfill our functions.

The summary table below outlines what we think are the general characteristics of an ideal tax system:

| **General Characteristic** | **Function** | **Non-Functional Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Practical_ | Raise Resources for Government Services (MMT: Validate Money); | Useable; Low Cost; Simple |
| _Beneficial_ | Ration Scarce Collective Resources and Bads; Macroeconomic Management | Economically Efficient |
| _Fair_ | Distribute Collective Rents Fairly; Correct for Maldistribution of Income and Wealth | Equitable |

## Functional Requirements of Tax and Welfare System

In simple terms there are three major functions of the tax and welfare system:

- Raise Revenue (Pay for Government Services)
- Ration Scarce Factors and Economic Bads (Share fairly inherently limited resources, Minimise environmental and health harm, ensure the economy develops beneficially)
- Correct Mal-distribution (Redistribute Income Fairly, Provide a safety net for those in need; help people into work; and ensure that the distribution of income is fair).


## Non-functional Requirements of Taxation System

Similarly we can consider there to be three main non-functional requirements

- Useable (Simple, With clear justification, Objective, With Low compliance costs, Low collection costs)

- Economically Efficient (Non Distortive, Not discourage productive activity, Secure tax base, Cannot be avoided or evaded)
- Equitable (Transparent, Fair, Internationally Cooperative)


## Non-functional Requirements of Welfare System

Similarly, a welfare system should be:

- Useable (Simple, Integrated, Value for money, Modern Technology)
- Efficient (Providing Incentives for Work, Skill Development)
- Equitable (Fair, Without Stigma)


# 5-7 Components Satisfying Requirements

## Options for Taxes

There are four different types of activities that we could tax.

1. Rents: Land, Property, Resources
2. Finance: Money Balances, Bank Balance Sheets, Transactions.
3. Environmental Health and Social Damage: Fossil Fuels, Transport Fuels, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Alcohol &amp; Tobacco, Sugar &amp; Salt
4. Cash Flow: Income, Profit, Capital Gains, Value Added (sales).

## Results for Taxes

We assessed 13 taxes according to our 8 criteria for taxes. The results are shown below.

| **Tax** | **Total Criteria reached (out of 40)** |
| --- | --- |
| Land Value Tax | 36 |
| Property Tax | 34 |
| Money Balance Tax | 34 |
| Tobacco and Alcohol Duties | 31 |
| Sugar and Salt Tax | 28 |
| Carbon Tax | 27 |
| Income Tax | 27 |
| VAT | 26 |
| Near-money or Bank Balance Sheet Tax | 26 |
| Capital Gain Tax | 24 |
| Corporation Tax | 19 |
| Wealth Tax | 18 |
| Transaction tax | 18 |


## Options For Benefits

We considered several different general types of welfare benefits.

**Universal benefits** include two categories of payment: those made to all citizens unconditionally (so called &quot;basic income&quot;) and those made to particular classes of citizens (such as the disabled, children and pensioners). The level of benefits does not depend on previous contributions or current income.

**Means-tested benefits** , by contrast, are income dependent. Those with higher incomes cannot receive the benefit. Means-tested benefits sometimes have further tests (e.g. those benefiting must also be applying for work). These tests would not usually apply in the case of a universal benefit. We can see that a means-tested benefit is in principle equivalent to a universal benefit plus a tax. Means tested benefits are usually cheaper in pure revenue terms (although this is mostly an artefact of the means testing not counting as a tax), but need more administration and involve more stigma. The system of government accounting should account for means-testing (in the benefits system) and taxation in the same way, so there's no false 'accounting' justification for means tested benefits.

**Contributory benefits (insurance):** Benefits can be considered a form of insurance. Access to contributory benefits is based on a prior record of payment of premiums or accumulated savings.

**Workfare / guaranteed jobs:** These are benefits that dependent on taking government-provided or government-subsidised employment. Here the rationale is to enable work experience through providing guaranteed work.

## Results for Benefits

Here are the results of applying our criteria to the possible welfare systems. We have three high scores and one clear loser, means-tested benefits. The choice between the three good options will be considered in the next section.

| **Benefits System**  | **Total Criteria reached (out of 30)** |
| --- | --- |
|Universal benefits e.g. 'Citizens Dividend'| 21 |
|Means- tested benefits | 12  |
| Contributory benefits (insurance)| 22 |
| Workfare or guaranteed jobs| 23 |

# 5-8 Conclusions

We have now completed our preliminary assessment of the taxation and welfare system, and have some preliminary ideas of what sort of taxes may have good features. We will now assess the distribution of income and wealth and the individual sectors of the economy to consider the details of what problems there are and what role the tax and welfare system can play in alleviating them.
