# PART 5: TAX IN PRINCIPLE

# 5.1: Why Tax?

This question is deceptively simple. In fact there are actually two questions. 

1. Why do we need to tax?
2. What justifies tax?

## Do We Need Tax?

Why Do We Tax? One of the first topics that one has to ask is why we should tax at all. 

The obvious answer to this is that we tax in order to make money for the government. But since the government can print and spend money if it chooses, this answer does not satisfy us. On the other hand if the government printed too much money this might cause inflation. So therefore it seems, indirectly, that the reason for taxing stuff is to control inflation, to maintain the value of the money that does exist in society. This is a theory. But for our purposes, it's the *difference* between tax and spending which we will assume could boost the economy or create inflation. It's not our purpose here to worry too much about that difference. 

When we says that 'Fred has a lot of money' we might mean one of two things. The first is that Fred is rich. He has houses, shares, businesses, fast cars. Actually he might not have much money at all, in the sense that his wallet might be empty and he might not have much in his current account. In technical terms we say we have assets.

The other meaning is more literal. We might need some cash for some reason. For example to pay a restaurant bill where they dont accept cards. In more technical terms we say that we have *liquid* assets. Liquid assets are assets we can use to buy stuff.

Well imagine two different strategies that the government can adopt. The first increases the wealth of the population, the second swaps some of the existing wealth for another form. It can be easily seen that it is likely that increasing his wealth is going to have a greater effect than increasing the amount of liquid assets ... unless he really is short of liquid assets.

The government can increase the quantity of assets in the economy by spending more than it receives in taxes. It can do this in two ways. The first way is simple: it can print money to pay for the difference between its spending and it's taxation. This increases the assets in the economy in a simple manner. There is simply more money in the economy.

In strict balance sheet terms, the government now has a liability and the private sector has an asset. It's not easy to see that banknotes are actually a government liability. For what are they liable? In fact they are liable for goods and services equal in value to the money outstanding. If the government sold something, say gold bars, this would be very easy to demonstrate. 

it would be easy to see that just like Tesco reward points are a liability to Tesco, because you can buy things in Tesco with them.

Thus we are going to assume, for now, that we need to raise tax in order to raise revenue for government. There are other ways of raising revenue for government; we are just going to assume that we need 

## What justifies tax? 

There are a lot of answers to that. We will cover some of them in our book: rent, externalities, discretionary economic power, ability to pay, compress consumption, ensure one group does not accumulate at the cost of another, protection services for asset owners.1

1.  The Need for Revenue: Governments need to tax for two reasons. Firstly they tax to fund ongoing public service, along the lines of Beveridge. Secondly they vary the balance between taxation and spending for macroeconomic reasons. The government needs the ability to influence to economy when the economy has broken down. 
2. Public Goods: If taxes fund public services. But it's important to note that taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. Talented individuals (scientists artists), everyday people in communities, institutions such as newspapers, charities, and companies all provide public goods.
3. The Social Contract: Taxes are one method for the enforcement of a social contract, a deal between and government and the people, where contribution is recognised.

4. Other reasons for taxes: Government has the choice about which taxes are imposed and what is taxes. Redistribution is one reason. Another reason for taxation is to correct for monopoly pricing and externalities. Generally if we look at the existing system, taxes tend to either have a redistributive purpose or a behaviour-changing purpose. Some taxes like VAT don't do much of either, but also have some advantages in terms of taxing.

## Our Assumptions

Assume we need publics services, we need tax. The amount of tax will vary. Our scope: how best to fund government; financial rights and obligations of corporate entities.

Strategic Tax Reform: We need a strategic long term principled approach

hareholder-stakeholder model? Who is the customer, who is the shareholder, who is the
The landlord at present is the shareholder in society. Rather he should be the customer, since the government provides. The people are currently the 'customer'. Actually they should be the shareholder, they should receive the dividends, once the common wealth has been built up.

## Objectives of Reform

`So what are our objectives)` for a reform of the tax and welfare system? Well, first, we have to reduce the risk of oligarchy.  What is oligarchy? It is 'rule by the few', specifically by the rich. And why is this a problem? Well, the problem is that when small groups of rich people have disproportionate influence in society, there is little that the rest of us can do. These groups could have a distortive influence on the tax code so that it better suits their interests. This would in turn be a problem for the majority.

Another area where the tax system could be used to benefit society is with the environment. Environmental taxes can help to ensure that the global environment is not damaged by our economic activities. Pollution is often considered a negative environmental externality. It's good for society to reduce these costs; taxing 'bads' helps to reduce them.

At present the current benefit system involves various 'benefit traps' and 'poverty traps'. A 'benefit trap' is a situation where it is better to stay on benefits than to take work, due to the perverse incentives built into the system. Because benefits are 'means- tested', when you gain work, you often lose equivalent benefits. Furthermore, poor people are often trapped in cycles of dependency. They have low skills and don't have the time and money to invest in themselves to improve matters. There may be children involved, in which case the high costs of childcare can be another factor. Drugs, abusive relationships, and crime can be other factors. When all of this is taken into account, it results in a dysfunctional benefit system that is confusing, unwieldy, unpredictable, and does not achieve its goal of supporting people into work. 



# 5.2: What could and should be taxed?

Taxes can be applied across a range of goods and services. We split these in to three: taxable assets, taxable transactions, and  taxable commodities. 

## Assets

- Land (residential, government, commercial, industrial, agricultural)
- Buildings (residential, government, commercial, industrial, agricultural)
- Money (cash and bank deposits)
- Companies (privately owned and shares in companies)
- Bonds (government and commercial companies's bonds)
- Capital goods such as machines, computers, etc.
- Infrastructure 
- Rights and permits e.g. patents
- Consumer durables including cars and house fittings etc.

## Transactions

- Wages
- Dividends
- Purchases
- Gifts
- Payments to suppliers
- Inheritance
- Purchase of assets e.g. houses and financial assets
- Physical investment
- Interest payments
- Compensation payments
- Transfers between bank accounts of the same person

## Physical Commodities

-  Pollution
-  Resources
-  Calorific Value / Food Composition

## Deciding What To Tax

But how do we decide what should be taxed? Which of these would fulfill the requirements of being beneficial, fair, and practical? To answer this, we must create a decision framework. 

1. Does private value reflect social value? If private value is greater than social value, increase tax until these two values are equivalent. 
2. If here is a need for more tax after taxing this value difference, tax things that are fixed in supply. This will mean that the tax does not have an effect of reducing real wealth. 
3. Transitioning to this system should preserve justice i.e. future increases in private value above social value should be taxed, while maintaining existing asset values where possible.

These taxes could be applied to a range of areas. For example, taxes could be applied to financial surpluses (e.g.(net) imports, profits, incomes over some threshold), and luxury expenditures whose demand is insensitive to price. Such taxes could help redistribute some or all of the surplus of those individuals, companies or geographical areas who are gaining financial assets.  

Taxes could also be applied to the unearned increment on scarce resources that are fixed or limited in supply, or monopolised e.g. land, fossil fuels and endangered fish.

Taxes could also help disincentivise environmental and health bads. These are activities that damage our common space (e.g. fossil fuels, other pollution, road congestion, ugly buildings)

# 5.3 Principles of a Reformed System
Taxes and benefits create incentives for good or ill. It's vital that these incentives are well-aligned with the interests of society as a whole. An improved tax and welfare system should be guided by economic, social and environmental objectives.

In the **short term**, we want a tax and welfare system that helps to create sufficient economic demand to ensure there are jobs for all who need them. There is no need for involuntary unemployment.

In the **medium term** , we wish to minimise the distortion caused by the tax system. The intention is to reduce or eliminate the losses of economic welfare caused by taxation and benefits. Private agents should pay the full costs of their behaviour. Where this behaviour impacts others negatively, a tax should be levied if that is practical.

In the **long term** , we need a tax system that encourages the UK to accumulate wealth ^[This term is defined in the main book.]. At the same time it should discourage destruction of natural wealth both in the UK and worldwide.

A well designed system would reconcile these competing objectives with the minimum of compromise. It could satisfy political objectives by demonstrating economic success and long term purpose. It would be very difficult to avoid, evade or 'game'. It would also not be susceptible to an international 'race to the bottom' where countries compete to reduce tax rates on companies and the super-rich.

An improved tax and welfare system would promote a wealthy society with a high quality of life. Hong Kong's system demonstrates the advantages of a simple tax system (although congestion, pollution and inequality remain of concern there). Germany, Switzerland, Singapore and the Nordic countries are rich countries we might wish to study and possibly emulate.

We must now assess particular taxes and benefits. First, we define the functions and desirable characteristics (non-functional requirements) of the tax-welfare system. We then sketch out options (taxes and benefits). We then assess these taxes according to the requirements. Our shortlist contains the taxes and benefits that score highest. Finally we select from the short list the taxes and benefits which together fulfill our functions.

The summary table below outlines what we think are the general characteristics of an ideal tax system:

| **General Characteristic** | **Function** | **Non-Functional Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Practical_ | Raise Resources for Government Services (MMT: Validate Money); | Useable; Low Cost; Simple |
| _Beneficial_ | Ration Scarce Collective Resources and Bads; Macroeconomic Management | Economically Efficient |
| _Fair_ | Distribute Collective Rents Fairly; Correct for Maldistribution of Income and Wealth | Equitable |

## Functional Requirements of Tax and Welfare System

In simple terms there are three major functions of the tax and welfare system:

- Raise Revenue (Pay for Government Services)
- Ration Scarce Factors and Economic Bads (Share fairly inherently limited resources, Minimise environmental and health harm, ensure the economy develops beneficially)
- Correct Mal-distribution (Redistribute Income Fairly, Provide a safety net for those in need; help people into work; and ensure that the distribution of income is fair).


## Non-functional Requirements of Taxation System

Similarly we can consider there to be three main non-functional requirements

- Useable (Simple, With clear justification, Objective, With Low compliance costs, Low collection costs)

- Economically Efficient (Non Distortive, Not discourage productive activity, Secure tax base, Cannot be avoided or evaded)
- Equitable (Transparent, Fair, Internationally Cooperative)


## Non-functional Requirements of Welfare System

Similarly, a welfare system should be:

- Useable (Simple, Integrated, Value for money, Modern Technology)
- Efficient (Providing Incentives for Work, Skill Development)
- Equitable (Fair, Without Stigma)


# 5.4 Components Satisfying Requirements

## Options for Taxes

There are four different types of activities that we could tax.

1. Rents: Land, Property, Resources
2. Finance: Money Balances, Bank Balance Sheets, Transactions.
3. Environmental Health and Social Damage: Fossil Fuels, Transport Fuels, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Alcohol &amp; Tobacco, Sugar &amp; Salt
4. Cash Flow: Income, Profit, Capital Gains, Value Added (sales).

## Results for Taxes

We assessed 13 taxes according to our 8 criteria for taxes. The results are shown below.

| **Tax** | **Total Criteria reached (out of 40)** |
| --- | --- |
| Land Value Tax | 36 |
| Property Tax | 34 |
| Money Balance Tax | 34 |
| Tobacco and Alcohol Duties | 31 |
| Sugar and Salt Tax | 28 |
| Carbon Tax | 27 |
| Income Tax | 27 |
| VAT | 26 |
| Near-money or Bank Balance Sheet Tax | 26 |
| Capital Gain Tax | 24 |
| Corporation Tax | 19 |
| Wealth Tax | 18 |
| Transaction tax | 18 |


## Options For Benefits

We considered several different general types of welfare benefits.

**Universal benefits** include two categories of payment: those made to all citizens unconditionally (so called &quot;basic income&quot;) and those made to particular classes of citizens (such as the disabled, children and pensioners). The level of benefits does not depend on previous contributions or current income.

**Means-tested benefits** , by contrast, are income dependent. Those with higher incomes cannot receive the benefit. Means-tested benefits sometimes have further tests (e.g. those benefiting must also be applying for work). These tests would not usually apply in the case of a universal benefit. We can see that a means-tested benefit is in principle equivalent to a universal benefit plus a tax. Means tested benefits are usually cheaper in pure revenue terms (although this is mostly an artefact of the means testing not counting as a tax), but need more administration and involve more stigma. The system of government accounting should account for means-testing (in the benefits system) and taxation in the same way, so there's no false 'accounting' justification for means tested benefits.

**Contributory benefits (insurance):** Benefits can be considered a form of insurance. Access to contributory benefits is based on a prior record of payment of premiums or accumulated savings.

**Workfare / guaranteed jobs:** These are benefits that dependent on taking government-provided or government-subsidised employment. Here the rationale is to enable work experience through providing guaranteed work.

## Results for Benefits

Here are the results of applying our criteria to the possible welfare systems. We have three high scores and one clear loser, means-tested benefits. The choice between the three good options will be considered in the next section.

| **Benefits System**  | **Total Criteria reached (out of 30)** |
| --- | --- |
|Universal benefits e.g. 'Citizens Dividend'| 21 |
|Means- tested benefits | 12  |
| Contributory benefits (insurance)| 22 |
| Workfare or guaranteed jobs| 23 |

# 5.5 Conclusions

We have now completed our preliminary assessment of the taxation and welfare system, and have some preliminary ideas of what sort of taxes may have good features. We will now assess the distribution of income and wealth and the individual sectors of the economy to consider the details of what problems there are and what role the tax and welfare system can play in alleviating them.
