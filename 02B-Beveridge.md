# 2-2: Beveridge and The Social Contract

Further down the street from Peter and Lucy lives Fred. Fred is on benefits. He once took a job, but he found that once this happened, his benefits were cut off. There was a gap between his new wage and the benefits coming in. Thanks to this, he didn't have the money for the rent. 

The UK has rolled out a reform known as 'Universal Credit', which integrates four income-related benefits into one. The 'benefits withdrawal' rate (in effect the income tax on additional income) on Universal Credit is 63%. This means that you  lose two thirds of the extra income you get. [Some of the problems with the new system include a delay in payment of benefits whilst administration takes place.] [*** Add to this later]

It does not have to be this way. One great milestone in the history of progress in the UK was the Beveridge report  [-@Beveridge1942]. Seventy-five years ago, liberal economist William Beveridge presented his report for a new welfare state. It laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its objectives were to banish 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. Beveridge argued for universal benefits, as of right. This can be contrasted with the system of means testing that has since developed. Three principles guided his report [@Beveridge1942: Part 1, paragraphs 6-9].

First, he argued that World War II and its aftermath was 'a time for revolutions, not patching'. He offered a radical approach, informed by the experience of the past. He would not be restricted by the interests of one group or another. In short, his report would be *radical* (working from first principles) and prioritise the *common interest*.

Second, he argued for a *comprehensive* solution to the five 'giant' social problems of the poor. His report dealt primarily with want (poverty) and disease (poor health). The other three 'giants' were ignorance (lack of education), squalor (poor housing), and idleness (unemployment). Accordingly, his report laid the basis not only for the UK's postwar welfare (or social security) system but also the National Health Service, public education, housing policy and a system of macroeconomic management aiming for full employment. 

Finally, Beveridge argued that there should be reward for contribution and service. The social contract of the mixed economy involves *cooperation* between the State and the individual. The welfare system should not stifle incentive, opportunity or responsibility. It would be an insurance system. It would involve a social contract of *giving* in return for *subsistence* benefits as a *right*, *without* means-testing. The state would offer the security of a subsistence standard of living in exchange for *service* and *contribution*. Welfare benefits would not preclude individuals from being employed or self-employed. Benefits would not be withdrawn as people earned more. The outcome has been very different from what Beveridge intended.

In summary, the Beveridge principles are as follows:

- *Radical*: From first principles, without fear or favour to social class or other interest groups.
- *Comprehensive*: Dealing with poverty, disease, bad housing, unemployment and a lack of education.
- *A liberal social contract*: No means testing and so no stifling of incentives; cooperation between the state, individuals and firms.

World War II had almost bankrupted Britain. Britain had financed the war through borrowing. The public debt ratio peaked at 238% of GDP in 1947. Despite this, post war Britain soon rebuilt itself. It also managed to provide for its people a standard of living greater than before the war. Britain pursued a policy of low interest rates, moderate inflation and high growth. Thus, it cut the burden of public debt to 70% of GDP in 30 years. [Ref: IMF WEO Paper?]

These accomplishments are in themselves remarkable. We will explain in more detail later.

Beveridge was  successful in his mission to lay the foundation for a comprehensive welfare state. Yet, some of his principles, especially the third, were unevenly applied. 

## Principle 1: A Fundamental Review

We also aim to look at tax and welfare from first principles. We will then apply those first principles without fear or favour.

But are we at a revolutionary time? Can we change a complex system like tax and welfare from first principles, or is 'patching' the only realistic possibility? We will assert that change is possible if it is beneficial, fair and practical, and communicated well so that these aspects are evident.

One does not make fundamental progress without thinking about what a system should do and what it should be. 

We also need to consider the motivation for, and the barriers to change. One barrier is the worry that some people will be made worse off by any changes. We need to ensure not only that the final state is fair but also that the transition between the current system and the new is also fair.

## Principle 2: The New Five Great Challenges

We still have Beveridge's giant social issues to some degree, but we are also faced with new problems. This book, like Beveridge's report, is devoted to five great societal challenges which face us now:
- *Widely-Spread Wealth*: Inequality of income and wealth, and especially that caused by arguably unfair means; tax avoidance and evasion; dominance of large mega-corporations with market power enriching the rich and wielding political power. Dealing with the challenge of increasing automation of work so that everyone has an adequate income and plenty of free time.
- *High Rent on Land and Resources*: Unaffordability of renting or purchasing homes, and the cost of importing fossil fuels.
- *Pollution and Other Environmental Damage*: Climate change, ocean acidification, plastics, overfishing and habitat loss which all threaten the future.
- *Debt and Economic Imbalance*: Rebalancing the economy away from borrowing and asset inflation, and towards balanced growth and wealth formation.
- *Tax Evasion and Avoidance*: Can a tax system be designed that is simple and yet difficult to avoid?

## Principle 3: A Social Contract Aligning Reward and Contribution

Our new welfare system should not disincentivise work and should encourage service and contribution. We will study in detail Beveridge's third principle to see if, and how, a better welfare system can be created. 

This involves the *integration* of the tax system with the benefits system so there is not a separate system of 'means testing'.  This function can be carried out through the tax system. This suggests the case for a system with a universal component: we call this a 'citizen's dividend' (a form of basic income). Furthermore, we argue for an integrated skills training and work experience system. These two proposals are outlined later.
