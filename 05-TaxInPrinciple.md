# PART 5: TAX IN PRINCIPLE

# 5-1: Why Tax?

It seems blatantly obvious that the authors of this book - **<u>Tax heaven</u>** - would be in favour of taxation. Taxes are, as we have argued in the previous chapters, a valuable method to pursue a variety of social objectives. In fact, they are probably one of the most important tools at the disposal of governments, despite the negative press that surrounds their use. 

It’s time for a PR campaign. Death and taxes may be inevitable, but taxes do not have to inevitably negative. The careful design of taxes can minimise the negative impacts, such as regressive impacts, poor behavioural incentives or evasion. The importance of the implementation and planning process cannot be understated. Nor can the importance of effectively communicating the intended purpose of the policy. The optics of policy design are key to minimizing resistance, and maximising success. 

There are, of course, those for whom the very mention of tax inflames strong passions. These passions exist across the political spectrum. Staunch libertarians claim that taxation is the blatant theft of private property, while social democrats often consider taxation to be a moral matter in the redressing of the unfairness of the free market. Emotions can, therefore, run high in debates on the purposes of taxation, and there often appears to be little common ground. This can make discussions of the philosophical basis of taxation somewhat difficult.

A precondition for successful design is, therefore, the comprehensive understanding of the purpose of the policy in question. In the case of taxation, this would be to answer the following questions: why and what do we need to tax; and what do we hope to achieve. It’s helpful when trying to communicate the purpose of a new tax to try and answer these questions both about taxation in a broad sense, and the individual policy itself. To what target and at what level do we set the tax; to who do the proceeds go; and what behaviours are affected by its application. It is only when these questions have been fully considered that effective tax policy can be created. We will outline our principles in this chapter for effective tax design, standing on the shoulders of giants in the field of economic theory to develop our assumptions. Ensuring that the policies that we create fulfil the requirements of being ‘practical, beneficial and fair’ is also a priority of our work; and is something on which we will expand later in this chapter. 

## Why Do We Need Tax?

The first question that must be answered is why we should tax at all. Taxes are traditionally unpopular policies, often seen by the public as a ‘tax grab’ on private assets and wealth. It seems then prescient to give an overview of the key positives that taxation policies can have. 

The simplest answer to this question is that tax is imposed so as to fund public spending. This government spending usually takes the form of investing in public infrastructure or on social provisions like housing, healthcare and education. The investment in these public goods is often only economical on a large scale – it’s not often that one individual can be responsible for a public park. The pooling of resources allows for these public goods to be supplied to a cross section of society that would otherwise be unable to access them. 

It’s worth stating that the provision of public goods does not only come from governmental sources. Artists, writers, community activists and philanthropists can all be said to provide public services of their own. Cafés which offer public restrooms, private enterprises which fund local newspapers, and institutions such as charities all provide public goods and services. However, the benefit of governmental provision lies in its ability to prioritise and maintain these services through democratic decision making, rather than relying on private benefactors.

But why doesn’t the government just print money to pay for these goods? The reason lies in legitimacy and inflation. Money is effectively an IOU of value from the institution that has issued the currency. If the government prints and spends money as it chooses, the legitimacy of this ‘IOU’ becomes compromised. Put more simply, if the government printed money on an unmanaged scale, this might cause inflation which would devalue the currency already in circulation.   This can lead to, in extreme cases, hyperinflation and fiscal chaos, whereby money loses its worth making it increasingly difficult for subscribers to pay for their goods. This would also limit the ability of the government to invest in public goods. Without a solid basis of assets, a public body is unable to guarantee that it will be able to pay for goods on a long-term basis. This is, then, why tax revenue is so important. 

There are several other ways in which a government can raise revenue. However, we identify taxation revenue as one of the core methods of supplying a government with the necessary funds for its activities.  This is in line with Beveridge’s principles of needing tax as part of a comprehensive policy package of funding ongoing public service. 

As we have hinted, it may also be that one of the reasons for taxation is to maintain the fiscal order and control inflation. The difference between tax revenue and spending is a large component factor of the economic growth and inflation paradigm. This theory is not a focal point of our analysis. However, the macroeconomic influence of the public spending balance, and deficit, cannot be understated. It is important that Governments manage this ratio, for reasons of international credibility in their fiscal strategy, the ability to source debt financing for public projects, and the extent to which fiscal policy can be used to boost a national economy after a recession. 

Another reason proposed for using taxation is also to emphasise the ‘social contract’ between a citizenship and their government. This is effectively a ‘deal’ by which the government is contracted to enact the aims and goals of those that they represent. Taxation could therefore be thought of as a method of enforcement of these designated responsibilities. It is, admittedly, not always the case that this is explicitly recognised by members of the government, but the ‘I pay for your salary’ argument can go far when shoring up a citizen’s right to complain or to lobby for the specific actions of a representative body. By establishing this stakeholder-shareholder model, we change the status of the citizen in society to the decision maker, and natural recipient of any ‘dividends’ from natural wealth. We also change the status of the landowner to a consumer of national resources, rather than the owner themselves. The shift in dynamics here may have considerable impacts on future resource management in the UK.

 As touched on, there are also several social objectives that can be achieved with the careful implementation of taxation. Redistributive policies are a large component of this public spending, sharing the wealth that is created in a collective society through income, housing and healthcare provisions. Another reason that taxation can be useful is to correct for monopoly pricing and externalities, or to change behaviour in some way that is designated as socially beneficial. Behavioural economists have only very recently, in terms of economic history, started to explore the nudge and norm-changing effects of taxation. These theories will be explored later in this chapter. 

Of course, noble objectives remain mere concepts until they are realised. In the world of policy, it is sometimes best to think of these as akin to ‘spectres’ that haunt the messy reality of designing and implementing policy. In doing so, we draw from Derrida’s ideas of the influence of justice in law – never actually achievable but rather existing as an influencing ideal that pushes the development of law [@Glendinning2016]. The same can be said for the objectives of taxation. The ability for tax to tackle inequality and social bads will only ever be as good as the practical reality of such policies in practice. We will expand on this later in the chapter. However, important to take from this is the significance both of the influencing ideas and also of their implementation. 

## Deciding What to Tax

Taxes can be applied to a range of goods and services. We will, going forward, term these targets as the ‘tax base’.  Ranging from the financial (e.g. financial surpluses (e.g.(net) imports, profits, incomes over some threshold), to the consumed (e.g. luxury expenditures whose demand is insensitive to price), there is broad scope for the tax base of a potential policy. 

Deciding which tax base to use can often be determined by the objective of the policy. Raising revenue is predominately achieved through income taxes. Taxes can also be used to for redistribution in society, such as when they are applied to the unearned increment on scarce resources that are fixed or limited in supply, or monopolised e.g. land, fossil fuels and endangered fish.  Taxes could also help disincentivise environmental and health bads. These are activities that damage our common space. Such taxes may also help redistribute some or all of the surplus of those individuals, companies or geographical areas who are gaining financial assets.

Overall, the are four different types of activities that we could tax:

1.     Rents: Land, Property, Resources

2.     Finance: Money Balances, Bank Balance Sheets, Transactions.

3.     Environmental Health and Social Damage: Fossil Fuels, Transport Fuels, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Alcohol Tobacco, Sugar Salt

4.     Cash Flow: Income, Profit, Capital Gains, Value Added (sales).

But how do we decide which tax base to use. One solution is to create a decision framework based on selected principles of justice and benefit. We define these as the preconditions of practicality, benefit and fairness, which will be elaborated on later in this chapter. The questions that we can ask ourselves to build this decision framework will help shape the ultimate design of the tax policy. This could apply to the schedule of assets that we decide to tax. 

The first order of deciding the tax base could be based on efficiency. By asking the question of whether the private value of a good reflects its social value, we can identify the tax base. Where private value is greater than social value, taxes would then be levied to the extent where these two values are equivalent. If there is a need for more revenue after taxing this value difference,  we could then prioritise efficiency by taxing things that are fixed in supply. Such a mechanism would avoid the distortionary incentives that taxation can have on income or wealth. 

 We could also choose to select this tax base on grounds of equity. By focusing on tackling private value inflation, we would begin to reduce the rate of growth of inequality in the UK [@Piketty2014a] by reducing the windfall gains associated with the returns on capital and wealth, as opposed to income. In doing so, we could preserve justice in the system. However, care must also be taken to ensure that existing asset values are not changed so dramatically as to cause injustice in the transitional process. One way in which to achieve this is by focusing these taxes on future increases in private value above the social value, rather than on the existing allocations.

## What are the Objectives of Reform?

It seems then that what we choose to tax, and at what level, depends on the purpose of the tax itself. 

If the goal is to reduce inequality, then taxes can be applied to private assets and income. Such taxes target the accumulation of wealth to both recapture societal contributions to its formation, and to ensure inequality does not grow extensively. Some argue that these taxes target oligarchy and monopolistic control of assets. We define *Oligarchy* as 'rule by the few', specifically by the rich, which can be an issue due to the disproportionate power that can be associated with a small number of wealthy people controlling the majority of a nation’s assets. Assets can often be synonymous with political power, which some postulate as being a negative for society. For example, such oligarchic groups could have a distortive influence on the tax code so that it better suits their interests. This may pose problems for the majority.

Another area where the tax system could potentially be used to benefit society is with the environment. Environmental taxes can help to ensure that the global environment is not damaged by our economic activities. Pollution is often considered a negative environmental externality. It's good for society to internalise these costs, and thereby reducing them. By adding a cost to these ‘negative externalities’ with a tax, the taxing 'bads' helps to reduce their output.

It is not just in the levying of the tax that this mechanism can be beneficial. Ensuring that the beneficiaries of the tax, i.e. where and on what the revenue is spent, correspond with the stated social aims behind the tax policy can bring a ‘double dividend’ of impact. For example, taxing polluting fuels and using the revenues to subsidise clean energy could potentially accelerate the development and implementation of clean energy provision in a country. Moreover, if a tax looks to have regressive impacts (i.e. hits the poorest in society at a disproportionate level, such as income tax), the revenues from such a tax could be given as a rebate to those most negatively affected to ensure that the policy retains political viability, as well as a broadly positive impact. We see this in the form of modern welfare benefits in the UK, despite the well-publicised problems in the system. These will be explored in a later chapter which explores the history and functionality of the UK welfare system. 

 

# 5-2 Historical perspectives 

Much of economic theory has considered what an ideal tax system should look like and how the practical application of these principles would function.

Adam Smith is perhaps the most celebrated economist to have considered this subject. He postulated that there were four axioms of taxation, which were that taxes should be convenient, objective, low cost both in terms of the direct costs of their administration and the discouragement they cause to others, and that they should be levied proportionally to an individual’s ability to pay. In 1776, Smith [-@smith1776wealth, Book V, Chapter I] argued that:

"Good taxes meet four major criteria. They are (1) proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay (2) certain rather than arbitrary (3) payable at times and in ways convenient to the taxpayers and (4) cheap to administer and collect."

A tax on land rents is also mentioned by Smith as an example of an optimal tax policy, writing the following;

"Both ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of revenue which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of the state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of industry. The annual produce of the land and labour of the society, the real wealth of the great body of the people, might be the same after such a tax as before. Ground rents and the ordinary rent of land are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax upon them"

David Ricardo [-@ricardo1821principles], Henry George [-@George1879], John Stewart Mill [-@mill1848principles], and Alfred Marshall [-@marshall1890principles] have also argued for the advantages of taxing land rent. Developing on this concept, Ricardo put together a model of different land qualities and their respective qualities and rents. He recommended a tax on landowners rent to ensure fair management of the limited land resources in the UK. Henry George also recommended a tax on land rent, extending Ricardo's reasoning to urban land. He noted that the speculators always would win, at the expense of everyday people, if land values were not regulated through taxation. Frank Ramsey [-@Ramsey1927] extended the argument to commodities in general, developing a formula for optimal taxation such that those commodities most inelastic in supply or in demand should be taxed the most. His work argued for the inverse elasticity rule: the amount of taxation payable on a commodity would be proportional to the sum of the reciprocal of the demand and supply elasticity for that good.

Meanwhile Arthur Cecil Pigou [-@Pigou1924] developed the idea of taxing negative externalities. These externalities can be defined as situations in which an economic activity damages actors who are external to the transaction concerned. A pertinent example would be pollution. The polluter pays principle has now become a major part of environmental policy theory, with major institutions like the IPCC and the World Bank arguing for the importance of a carbon tax in managing global emissions. Closer to home, political institutions such as the Green Fiscal Commission in the UK have analysed, and recommended, carbon taxes as a way to reduce environmental bads. These findings are similar to those of the Mirrlees review, and indeed the Government currently applies a ‘carbon price floor’ as a method by which to achieve this. 

On wealth and inequality, there is a substantial body of work on the impact that taxation can have. Keynes' Polish contemporary, Kalecki, argued that taxation of wealth would increase effective demand and therefore economic growth without stifling incentives [@Kalecki1937]. And more recently Piketty [-@Piketty2014a] has shown the consequences for the growth in inequality if wealth and high income are not sufficiently taxed.

There have also been several contemporary reports into taxation in practice. The UK was the source of the preliminary exploration of what was to be the basis of the modern welfare state. Beveridge’s comprehensive plan for a ‘cradle-to-grave’ tax and welfare system was ground-breaking in its day, planning to use progressive taxes to discourage and to pay to ameliorate the five great evils he identified. More recent updates on modern taxation in the UK have included the Meade Review on direct taxation [@Meade1977] and the Mirrlees Review into taxation [@Mirrlees2010d], [@Mirrlees2011]. The former recommended a cash-flow taxation system of taxing consumption, findings which were echoed by the Mirrlees study. This study found that applying a deduction for the normal cost of capital could achieve comparable results, alongside a raft of other land-based taxes (such as a land value tax/proportional property tax) to replace business rates and/or council tax. There have also been similar reviews in Canada [@Carter1966], the United States [@Bradford1977] and, more recently, in Australia [@Henry2010] and New Zealand [@evans2011reflections]. 

Standing on the shoulders of these giants, we can derive two general principles. First, that the allocation of capital needs to account for the total costs and benefits to society, rather than just to the private profit of an individual. This involves a rethink of what property rights actually entail and will enable taxes to be used to enact broader social aims. Using taxation to internalise the *externalities* that result from economic action will therefore ensure that the total benefits and costs are incorporated into economic decision making, which in turn will combat the inefficiencies and market failure of allowing these to persist. 

Secondly, the importance of distributed ownership of and returns from assets becomes clear. Any taxes that are implemented should prioritise the minimisation of any inequalities that might result. This, in turn, means using taxation and regulation to manage the ability of an economic actor to assume monopolistic control over private assets and exploit *economic rent*. If we convert this into economic language, we can say that the priorities for any taxation system should be to focus on externalities and rent. 

# 5-3 Principles for Taxation

In our introduction, we discussed the core questions that must be answered if taxes are to be used effectively. Rather than being understood as an important tool for social progression, taxes are relegated to an inevitability, a necessary evil, and a yearly burden. As the old saying goes - there is nothing so certain in life as death and taxes.

But, even if we assume that taxes are a necessary evil, then we must establish some guiding principles on how they should be applied. If we accept the idea that taxes should be focused on the two broad economic aims of managing economic rent and externalities, then the next step becomes to establish how exactly these policies should be designed to do so. Key considerations include the political acceptability of said policies, and the careful design of their implementation and structure to minimise any unwanted and unanticipated impacts. 

By doing so, we create a framework that serves to sense-check the policies that have been put forward. As our starting point, we have chosen three core characteristics which we suggest that all taxes should possess. These are as follows: that taxes should be *beneficial*, *practical* and *fair*.

 In other words, we are prioritising any new policies being “without harm”, “just”, and “functionable”. To any one fed up with policy-wonk, the clarity of such definitions is evidently important. For this purpose, we will walk through the expanded definitions of this criteria below.

## Beneficial (Not Harmful)

To be beneficial is to do good overall. There are multiple ways in which different taxes might be said to 'do good', and people may fairly disagree on what 'good' means. However, all taxes must have some legitimate claim to be beneficial. Most would agree that a tax is beneficial if it pays for valued public services. For example, taxation that pays for our National Health Service, our emergency services, our roads, schools and public transport, is generally considered necessary and beneficial. This is evidenced by a recent survey of British citizens [@PWC2017] which found that the majority would be willing to pay more tax if it leads to improvements in the quality of the NHS. 

More contentiously, taxation may be said to be doing good by redistributing income (or at least ensuring that the rich contribute more), helping to alleviate poverty, and reducing large wealth disparities. The proceeds of tax may be also used to ensure a minimum standard of living by providing an income 'safety net'. This is evident in countries which have adopted the ‘welfare state’ ideology, whereby taxes levied on income are used to create a cushion for those at the lower income spectrum. 

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behaviour by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage our natural environment, and health, by polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less-polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. By taxing harm, it encourages companies to include these costs in their decision-making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or investing to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such land. Of course, if tax is not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Instead the private sector, specifically, the existing owners will ration the resources through increasingly higher prices (rents), and in so doing provide unearned value or income to those who control them. Taxation can be used to ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced so that the entire country benefits.

## Fair (Just)

There are three ways in which we think taxes must be fair. These are by maintaining consistency, progressivity, and transitional justice. 

As seems obvious, the first condition is that taxes must be fair by being consistent. Identical persons, companies and situations should be treated identically. There should be no special exemptions or 'sweetheart deals' for favoured individuals or companies. This seems obvious. In practice however, this principle is often flouted by powerful companies.

Related to this idea of fairness are concepts of accountability and transparency. Taxes must not just *be* fair but must be *perceived to be* fair. Taxes should  therefore be clear and transparent, such that it is apparent to everyone what the proper tax burden should be for each income bracket. These issues are particularly topical in Britain today. In early 2017, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee expressed concern that HMRC's 'lack of transparency' concerning high net worth individuals 'has eroded public trust in a fair tax system' [@HoC2017].

Another, perhaps more controversial, kind of fairness concerns *progressivity*. A progressive tax is a tax in which those who have more, pay more. UK income tax is thus a progressive tax as richer citizens pay more proportionally than poorer citizens. We think that this is fair and thus we believe that taxes should be fair in the sense of being progressive. However, this viewpoint is not without controversy.

Fairness is also relevant to our discussion of economic rents and land values. When land values increase because of work performed by society as a whole, by our definition it would be fair if all citizens benefit. It would seem unfair for only some people to benefit. Similarly, it would seem unfair if only a few people benefited from the country's natural resources - resources which were not created by any person, but which form part of national wealth. 

Finally, fairness is necessary in the transition from the existing system to the new system. This is necessary not only for reasons of justice, but also the political feasibility of the reforms: if they are seen as unfair, they would be unpopular.

## Practical (Functions Smoothly)

If a tax was fair and intended to do good, but couldn't be implemented without requiring masses of paperwork, or prohibitive costs, or extreme social controls, then no matter the benefit, it would not be justifiable. Taxes must be practical to implement. 

When considering whether a tax is practical, we might consider how close it is to a theoretical ideal. Ideally, a tax should be simple to implement and administer. It also should have low collection and compliance costs. This means that it should not cost the government huge sums to collect, and it should also be simple for taxpayers to comply with. The less paperwork, time-consuming research and confusing the rules involved, the better. Taxes which are automatically collected are more practical in this regard than those which require excessive amounts of form-filling and record-keeping. 

One pertinent drawback from over complication of tax policy is tax evasion. This has been a particularly hot topic in recent years. There is a difference between tax avoidance and evasion. Tax avoidance is the *legal* dodging of tax; tax evasion is the *illegal* dodging of tax. A tax which is easily evadable or avoidable will not be practical because it will not function to increase public funds. It may also require significant resources to be wasted chasing up non-complying 'tax cheats'. It is also important to avoid an international 'race to the bottom' where countries compete to reduce tax rates on companies and the super-rich. Ensuring that taxes are as smartly designed as possible, within a holistic policy package, will help to reduce this risk.

Another aspect of practicality is predictability. Individuals and companies must be able to predict future expenses in order to manage their financial planning. In a similar vein, taxes must be clearly defined so that taxpayers can plan their affairs while knowing exactly how much tax they can expect to pay. This scenario emphasises the need for steady transitions and well communicated policies when applying any policy change. 

# 5-4 A Framework for Reform

## Principles in practice

How to think about these principles in a practical sense? As mentioned above, ideals remain ideals until they are successfully realised. We therefore recommend thinking of these concepts – practicality, benefit and fairness, with mind to the ideas of Derrida’s justice referenced before, haunting the proceedings of change. Practicality, benefit and fairness become therefore ideas to chase after when designing any new tax policy, and they refrain from becoming restrictive principles which limit the development of any policy. The perfect should not become the enemy of the good. 

This is what the conditions of practicality, benefit and fairness are. No system will be perfect, but the strategic design of any new policies to prioritise clearly defined purposes and visible benefits sits at the heart of their success. Incorporating this conception of these principles into a framework for guiding reform is our final task in this chapter. 

So, what does all this mean for our new tax system? Having discussed historical ideas of what we should tax, outlined practical considerations for why we should tax, and touched on the guiding principles that should lie behind the design of any new policy, the clearest takeaway is that there is a lot to consider! It’s no wonder that tax has a bad reputation. The complexity of designing a successful policy lies in the sheer number of considerations that must be made to try and achieve the multiple goals of raising revenue, tackling social norms, managing monopoly and preserving equality; all while circumventing a Kafkaesque scenario of bureaucratic nightmare. 

However, we can find our way out of this maze. By rearranging and summarising the above into a clearer, decision tree format, we can begin to pull together the threads of a decision framework that we can use to link tax in principle with that in practice. 

It’s clear from above that consideration of taxes can be subdivided into establishing the objectives and targets of the policy, and the guiding characteristics of the policy design itself. In our framework, we term these distinctions as the functional and non-functional requirements of the tax system. We outline these clearly below.

 

## Functional requirements of Tax and Welfare System

In simple terms there are three major functions of the tax and welfare system:

- Raise      Revenue: (Pay for government services)
- Ration      Scarce Factors and Economic Bads: (Share limited resources, minimise      environmental and health harm, and ensure the economy develops      beneficially)
- Correct      Mal-distribution: (Redistribute income fairly, provide a safety net for      those in need; help people into work; and ensure that the distribution of      income is equitable).

## Non-functional requirements of Taxation System

Similarly, we can consider there to be three main non-functional requirements

- Useable:      (Simple, with clear justification, objectives and low compliance and      collection costs.)
- Economically      Efficient:  (Non-distortive, applied      to a secure tax base, and with low capacity to evade/avoid.)
- Equitable:      (Transparent, fair, and internationally Cooperative)

## Non-functional Requirements of Welfare System

We can also apply a similar mindset to the use of tax revenue in the case of the welfare system. 

A welfare system should be:

- Useable:      (Simple, integrated, value for money, with the use of modern Technology)
- Efficient:      (Providing incentives for work, and skill development)
- Equitable:      (Fair, Without Stigma)

## Paths forward

Taxes and benefits create incentives for good or ill. It's vital that these incentives are well-aligned with the interests of society as a whole. An improved tax and welfare system should include the functional and non-functional ideas above to promote total wealth in society. A well-designed system would reconcile the seemingly competing objectives of equity and efficiency with the minimum of compromise. Effective communication and steady implementation could also satisfy political objectives through clearly demonstrating the economic, social or environmental objectives that a policy was designed to achieve. 

The summary table below outlines what we think are the general characteristics of an *ideal* tax system:

| **General Characteristic** | **Function**                                                 | **Non-Functional Requirement** |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| *Practical*                | Raise   Resources for Government Services (MMT: Validate Money); | Useable;   Low Cost; Simple    |
| *Beneficial*               | Ration   Scarce Collective Resources and Bads; Macroeconomic Management | Economically   Efficient       |
| *Fair*                     | Distribute   Collective Rents Fairly; Correct for Maldistribution of Income and Wealth | Equitable                      |

 

By using this framework, we can more clearly evaluate past and create new tax policy with a view to promoting equity and efficiency. This framework of principles is, in our opinion, an essential evaluatory criterium for strategic tax reform. 

However, it is not enough to have strong principles behind the design of tax policy. We must maintain the idea that tax is in strong need of a PR campaign. One such method lies in clearly tying outputs from tax revenue to the purpose that they are intended to tackle. This, for example, could be using revenue from a carbon tax to act as a ‘green investment’ funding source. Another could be in opening up the discussion around the idea, mentioned previously, of a shareholder-stakeholder model of society. By asking the question of who exactly the stakeholders and shareholders are in society. and who should receive the ‘dividends’ from different forms of wealth, the path may be opened to more fundamental change in the UK tax system. One final suggestion could lie in highlighting success stories from other countries and constituencies, where tax policy has been received positively from the communities it affects. 

In our next chapter, we will explore these ideas of implementation and functionality, as we move on to how these principles are applied in practice.
