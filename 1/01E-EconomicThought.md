# Economic Thought

Economics is the study of activities that are, at least in part, motivated by financial gain or that involves resources that are inherently scarce. Economics used to be called *political economy*. This term comes from Ancient Greek. Political in an older sense means 'in relation to the *polis*'. *Polis* in turn means the city-state, the name for the political organisation in ancient Greece. Economy comes from two Greek words *Oikos*, meaning household, and *Nomos* meaning law. Therefore, *Oikonomos* means household management and, in English, the term *political economy* comes from the notion of household management of the state.

Classical political economy -- the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx -- was written in prose. Modern economics is often written in maths! Classical political economy dealt with the economy as a dynamic process and did not shy away from grand statements about divisive topics such as how the economy distributed its gains. Thus, the works of political economy by the great authors always had questions of taxation at their heart. What is an efficient and fair taxation system given what we know about the principles of political economy? Thus at the heart of political economy has always been the question of just distribution and of taxation as a means to remedy the situation. 

This makes political economy -- and now economics -- powerful. Also, it means that economics has implications for the financial interests of everyone. One can believe an economic theory for scientific reasons, but one might also support some theory because it furthers one's own interests. This makes political and economic discourse somewhat fraught. It also means that there is a suspicion that the corrupting power of self-interest may affect the balance of those economic theories that are thought authoritative. In this book, we aim to reconcile classical, neoclassical, Keynesian and modern system dynamic economic thinking to give a more authoritative approach.   

In our chapter on economics, we define some classical economic problems. How are prices determined? How does the economy distribute the gains from economic progress? Does self interest and the free market provide a desirable outcome?

These questions are related not only to economic processes -- for example, production and competition -- but also to taxation and the structure of private property. What assets can be owned? And, who in fact owns the assets? And how much tax should they pay for owning  assets or for engaging in economic activity? Desirable economic outcomes depend not only on economic activity but also on the taxation system and the system of property rights.

Adam Smith, in his famous work *The Wealth of Nations*, set out an economic model of how economic growth could lead to widely-spread prosperity. He argued that the division of labour leads to higher levels of productivity. 

If an entrepreneur makes an improvement in production processes, he can lower his cost of production and still sell at the price of his competitors. In other words, he can make a profit. In the short term, therefore, the advantages of his improvement accrue to him. Thus, the profit motive provides an incentive to make improvements. 

His competitors may notice the improvement that he has made and replicate it. To capture market share, they will lower their prices towards the new cost of production. There might be a price war to capture customers. After the competition has taken its course, we will be left with a different situation. The price of the good concerned will have fallen to just above the new production cost. The new beneficiary of the technological improvement would be everyone who purchases the product. Technological progress, the profit motive and competition would lead to widely-spread prosperity. 

This model relies on certain assumptions. A production process, once improved, can be replicated. There must be enough market participants for competition to work. If there is only a single monopolist or if entrance to the market is expensive then competition will not work as described. The beneficiary will be the owners of the single monopolist or the incumbent firm. 

Similarly, if the process relies on some factor of production that cannot be replicated, for example, land, then the beneficiary of the economic progress will be the landlords. 

Usually, damaging other people or their interests (for example, through injury or theft) is illegal. But some economic activities which damage others are still legal. Driving a car, which pollutes the environment and could harm pedestrians if there is an accident, is legal and normal, but nevertheless, damaging to others' interests. Small, indirect damages from many independent sources can add up to a lot in total. 

What seems acceptable when societies are small may nevertheless be unacceptable when societies are larger. For example, Newfoundland fishermen could fish without constraints when their boats were small and their numbers low. There were plenty of fish. However, fish stocks are not unlimited. There is a limit on how many fish can be taken before it damages the fishery. If too many fish are taken, then the fish don't get a chance to reproduce, and the fish stocks collapse. This is what happened in Newfoundland. Fish used to be so plentiful that the sea teemed with life. But after the collapse in the fish stock, many fishermen went out of business.       

Economics needs to account for these external damage. Taxation should also correct the market, so those who damage the environment pay for the damage that they cause.

## Taxation Thought

One key challenge to taxation is working out a means of taxation that can tax wealth and flows of income across international boundaries. Generally, the issue is as follows: One cannot tax big companies or rich individuals because they will simply move their money abroad. Furthermore, we might even wish to reduce our taxes on companies to encourage them to locate in our country. This is problematic because it tends to lead to companies paying less and less tax. 

Such a challenge also applies to the taxation of fossil fuels. If we tax emissions that are produced in the UK, this might encourage UK-based producers to move outside the UK. If instead, consumption of carbon-intensive goods is taxed, imports of goods produced abroad would be in scope, but exports would not. This would be helpful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would give a true picture of the emissions that a country is responsible for due to its consumption behaviour. Secondly, it creates a true incentive for exporting countries to decarbonise their economy. Thirdly, it encourages production processes to be improved, rather than simply relocated abroad. 

Taxation of wealth also faces similar issues. Taxation theory aims to identify a base of taxation that is unresponsive to the tax. So in taxing wealth, we could argue for taxation of assets rather than taxation of wealthy individuals. Land is a straightforward asset to tax in this way. Land cannot just move out of the country. 

Taxing corporate wealth is more difficult because a corporation is a more fluid and mobile than land. In this book, we suggest two radical strategies. 

The first approach is the taxation of profits calculated as UK sales minus UK costs. This approach encourages companies to locate their costs in the UK. The higher the tax rate, the more operations would be moved to a UK base. 

The second approach is an apportionment of multinational wealth based on where the sales of the companies are located. 

Thus both for environmental damage and for wealth, we use consumption as a relatively fixed tax base.
