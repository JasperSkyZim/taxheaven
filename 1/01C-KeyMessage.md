This book is about the economic conditions for sustainable prosperity. Why, given great technological and economic progress, do we still have problems? Why, amidst so much wealth, are many of our lives so precarious? Many of us are just about managing when we should be prospering.

In the 1960s, it took an average person in the UK on average wages four years wages to buy their own home. Why now does it take an average person on average wages ten years buy the same home? 

If we have all the technology to solve our environmental problems  then why are we not solving them? 

The 19th century writer Henry George's book 'Progress and Poverty' asked a similar question. Why, given technological progress, did we still have so much poverty? George argued that it was the private ownership of land that caused poverty.

We have a market economy with competition, growth and technological progress. Why do we have environmental pollution, despite having the wealth and technological ability to prevent them. Our economic system is not allowing us to take full advantage of the progress that we make. So why do we have these problems of pollution and precariousness? We identify three phenomena described by the great economists. 

When one person or company's behaviour damages another we call this 'economic theft'. So for example, if I throw my plastic waste into the ocean, it can then damage fish and other marine life. My careless action has stolen from the future of the ocean. 

We call the third notion 'generalised rent'. Imagine I am a landlord. Once I own some land with property on it, I can sit back and enjoy the flow of income, without having to work. This flow of income is rent. Rent goes up, as wages increase.if I own a big monopoly with no competition, I can also own a permanent flow of profits that competition will not touch. We term these two forms of property income 'generalised rent'. Generalised rent is a permanent flow of income associated with an asset that cannot be replicated. 

The result of these economic effects is that we have too much pollution, not enough genuine wealth and economic growth that benefits the rich. In some countries, economic growth may even stop. For the planet as a whole, this model is catastrophic. This book shows a route out of this economic situation.

Economists have been aware of these effects for some time. Yet, taxes which would correct these economic distortions have only been imposed occasionally and partially. Why haven't corrective taxes been imposed? The common answer is that taxes on rent and economic theft (negative externalities) threaten powerful interests. This view has some merit. However, there is another problem. Nobody has made a sufficiently passionate and positive case for these taxes. This book aims to correct that. 

Economists should work out ways to impose the economic effect of such taxes whilst minimising the resistance to them. Resistance to taxes is associated with concentrated losses on specific groups. These groups can easily mobilise to resist new taxes. So taxes, which could change the nature of these agents (for example, converting an oil company to a renewables producer) cannot be imposed because the very same agents resist the taxes as they oppose their interests. But these interests would change if the nature of the company was to change from oil to renewables. So we a have catch-22 situation. We can't change the companies without the tax. But we can't impose the tax without changing the company, since they resist politically. Instead, we need forms of tax that don't face such resistance but which lead to the transformation of companies in a positive direction. 

There has been tremendous technological progress and economic growth. But we still have problems. We have economic insecurity and pollution. 

What would an economy fit for our children look like? I think it would have two important aspects. Firstly, the beautiful things that require care, like the natural environment, would be preserved. Second, the limited things would be rationed by taxes rather than by private property, so that everyday people have a stake in the common resources and land doesn't become so expensive that individuals cannot afford their own homes.

This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich or poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well-informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super-rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore, it is a book about economics. If the private sector is not to harm our general well being, then an effective tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system would tax bad things, not good things. And it taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The physical use of natural resources should be taxed, and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus, we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with benefits, training, finance, energy and housing. Our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus, leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having a new purpose.
