# 0. INTRODUCTION (Early draft)

## Turning Spaceship Earth away from a Perfect Storm

The film 'A Perfect Storm' describes a true story of a fishing trawler facing a particularly wicked storm. A ship's captain and his fellow New England fishermen had fallen on hard times after poor catches. The captain, played by George Clooney, had assembled a crew and hired a boat to go out for one last fishing trip before the season was out. They sailed out into the mid-Atlantic. After much fruitless searching, they finally struck fish and turned for home, hoping to get the catch back whilst still fresh. 

Unfortunately a storm was brewing, and not just any storm. Three separate weather systems had merged to create a 'weather bomb'. Meteorologists warned of a serious threat to any fishing boats that braved what would become an epic storm. The fishermen faced the difficult question:  whether to attempt to land their catch whilst still fresh by heading home straight through the storm, or avoid the storm by staying in the mid-Atlantic until the weather system passed and risk the fish being no longer fresh enough to sell once back. Added to this dilemma were communications and leadership difficulties. Communications between the weather forecasters and the boat were interrupted by the degradation of the communications systems. The captain, whilst charismatic, also betrayed hubris and poor judgment.

It is odd, after all, that Clooney and his men felt they needed to take such a severe risk. Why were they in that situation in the first place? Whilst we cannot read other people's minds (let alone the minds of the dead) we can say that there are two main reasons for the original plight of the fishermen which led them to take such extreme risks: environmental damage and economic insecurity. 

First, the seas were no longer as plentiful as they once were. In the past [when?] the Grand Banks off Newfoundland teemed with fish. But overfishing led to a collapse in fish stocks. Similarly, the fishermen whilst having a valuable profession, do not own exclusive rights to fish. 

Second, the fishermen lacked economic security in their lives. They had to fish or go bust. Beyond their own homes, they owned little. Their boats were owned by investor who expected a return and did nothing so dangerous as to actually head out to sea. An absentee landlord, he simply rented out the boat and lived off the surplus. We never meet him but his presence makes himself felt. The fishermen were economically expendable, a bit like low value fish that are disposed off the side.

We on Earth are perhaps facing a similar situation to Clooney's character and his crew. There are warnings of a dangerous climactic and environmental future for the world on the path currently taken. Clever people disagree over whether to take the environmental warning seriously or not: some of us think it's all a hoax others say its just natural variability.  We need to decide how to interpret these warnings -- whether to ignore them, like the fateful crew, or to take them seriously. 

But even if we don't ignore the warnings, we have another problem. You and I don't control the direction of the world economy. There is no single captain of spaceship earth. 

Also we have little idea how the controls of Spaceship work. And there is little focus on the practicalities of what to do next. This book attempts to use the tax and financial system to change the incentives of the private sector to do the right thing. And it deals with the question of how to make the change.

## About This Book

This book is addressed to those who are looking for a new economic model for rich and poor countries across the world. The intended audience includes economists, scientists, politicians, businesspeople, other professionals and interested members of the general public.

it is concerned with how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent',  international flows of money and assets. Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without governance systems to constrain them. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies, leading to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich. International tax  avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep. 

The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems. The book proposes a simple and effective tax and social security system to solve these problems and to enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet.

We are interested in two other systems in particular that overlap with the tax system: the financial and monetary system, the social security (also known as welfare or 'benefits') system including skills training. The examples given relate to the reform of the UK tax and welfare system, but the ideas herein are intended to be applicable to most societies around the world. Out of scope is the detail of the benefits system and the detailed technicalities of how some taxes  work at the moment. We keep it to the broad scale big picture more than the accounting of taxes, although we do cover some implementation choices.

## Economics, Opportunity And Hope

This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich are poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore it is a book about economics. That is not to say that the government can't do good and important things. But if the private sector is not to do bad things for our general well being then the right tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system taxes bad things not good things, and taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The main point is that physical use of natural resources should be taxed; and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes  natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with the benefits and training system, the finance system, the energy system and the housing system. In short our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having new purpose to grow opportunity in our society. We do this through a transformation of the incentives.

## Historical Case Studies

We wish not just to minimise the costs of taxation, but rather to aim for taxes, where possible, that are actively beneficial. Good taxes would shape the profit motive towards the needs of people, communities, and the living planet on which we all depend. Here we seek a tax and social security system that is not only fair and practical, but also beneficial to everyday people, our country and our world. Our argument would be more concrete if we could point to situations around the world where this might happen.

**Welfare and Work -- Beveridge and the UK in the late 1940s**

As we discuss in chapter 3, the Beveridge report shows a possible way forward for welfare. Before the second world war, the five social evils of Want, Squalor, Idleness, Disease and Ignorance ravaged the poor in Britain. the second world war destroyed many buildings, homes and businesses alike, and increased the government and external debt. But yet the post war government managed to create a comprehensive welfare state where none existed before: a health service, It also managed its debt.

**Finance: Financial 'Repression' in the UK in the period 1945-1980**

One great anxiety is about *debt*. There are basically two forms of debt that concern people: public (or government) debt and private debt. High public debt pressures governments to 'cut the deficit' through 'austerity'. Yet in the past, the best way to reduce the burden of public debt has been not to worry about it: or rather to use different strategies. In the three decades after the second world war, the UK reduced its public debt to GDP ratio from over 250% of GDP to 70% of GDP. It did this not through austerity, but rather through growth, inflation, monetisation of some debt, and low interest rates. We consider the fiscal benefits of such strategies later in this book.

**Income and Corporation Tax: USA in the period 1945-1980**

The United States in the post war showed the advantage of redistributive income taxation, including high tax rates on companies. The top rate of income tax was often over 70% in that period, and taxes on companies were also higher than at present. Because everyone's incomes were not widely different, this meant that normal people could not only afford consumer goods, but also everyone had a chance to buy the limited positional goods such as land. Since the top rate of tax was high, and since income tax is the largest and most important tax, this meant that the average tax rate paid by people on average earnings was lower. We discuss this is parts 6 and 7.

**Land Value Capture: Singapore and Hong Kong since independence**

Singapore shows what has been termed the 'property state' [@Haila2015]: it shows what is possible when there is a 'prosperity loop' between investment in public infrastructure and public rent collection. In short, as the government makes infrastructure improvements, those increase the rental value of the land, and those land value increases then accrue to the government. Hong Kong also shows the advantages of this approach: before a new metro line is built, land near the new stations is purchased at pre-announcement cost and so society captures the land value benefit of the new infrastructure [Purves. We discuss this is part 8.

**Environmental Taxes: Scandinavia, Switzerland and the UK **

Three European countries show that a carbon tax can work exactly as planned. Sweden, Switzerland and the UK all have a carbon tax. Sweden was one of the first to introduce its carbon tax and the per capita $CO_2$ emissions of Sweden are now amongst the lowest in Europe. Similarly Switzerland has also introduced such a tax. The UK introduced its carbon price floor more recently, and it has seen a large fall in emissions. Most notably we have seen a drop in the use of coal in electricity generation. Other environmental taxes include charges for plastic bags. 

## A Theory of Change

The way that we need to set up this tax system needs to maximize the effect whilst minimizing the resistance. It's this sort of system that can maximize the good that can be achieved. In two areas in particular: in environmental/energy policy and in housing policy. If you want to have a big effect you need a big incentive, but big incentives cause big losers and therefore political resistance. In other words we use financial incentives to promote wider forms of entrepreneurship for public benefit.

We suggest four forms of entrepreneurship. Firstly public good entrepreneurship: we suggest that the private sector be turned over to public good provision. the obvious example is green entrepreneurship, but we also suggest ways that companies can tackle other global issues such as the lack of good antibiotics. The second issue is state capitalism entrepreneurship. This involves both the state and capitalists. The third is municipal land value entrepreneurship, as has been seen in Singapore and Hong Kong. The fourth is skill based personal and social entrepreneurship. There's a fifth overarching concept too, which we term policy entrepreneurship. That is, we should break out of the monopoly of thought imposed on us by neoclassical economics and neoliberal economic ideas. These forms of entrepreneurship imply a new growth model for everyone, one that is not based on increasing financialization and debt issued on limited assets but rather the development of productive industries solving our collective problems

What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, good and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately. 

## Proposals

We will set out how, on a consumption basis, \*taxing\* the environmental damage that people cause is sensible, that we should tax unproductive and unearned wealth, and finally we should tax luxury consumption using the income tax system to ensure it is progressive.

We also have some reforms for the benefits and training system. We suggest a dividend for everyone, a cheque in the post -- and to integrate the tax and benefits system, replacing means testing with taxation (since it achieves the same thing, taking money away from people as they earn more). We also suggest an active benefits system for training people up in high skills. We suggest the accumulation of wealth across the poor, rather than the government having the responsibility to support them. Then, when people pay their tax, some of that tax would be set aside as a contribution that will fund the purchase of assets, a return to a contributory tax system.

Finally we suggest changes to the financial system. Allied to our tax on wealth is a tax on lending on unproductive wealth. Thus we encourage investment across the economy. We use the financial system to actively promote the capture of land rent for public purposes. We suggest particularly low cost loans for the building a new cost infrastructure, in this country and around the world. Finance is particularly international and lending can ensure that everyone gets enough energy.

## Four Crucial Benefits of Good Taxes

There are four crucial benefits of a better taxation system to wider society:

1) *A clean and safe global environment:* The first priority is the environment. Starting with the most important part of the tax system, the system of environmental taxation. There are a number of major environmental problems facing us, most notably climate change and ocean acidification, but also including the prevalence of plastics in the ocean, habitat destruction, road congestion, overfishing, rare resource consumption and conventional air, water and land pollution. Using environmental taxes faces a few challenges: they can be unpopular, hard to design, encourage 'offshoring' of dirty forms of manufacture and bureaucratic. Finally, because sometimes demand for damaging products can be unresponsive to price, a high environmental tax may be necessary, but high environmental taxes may be unpopular, disruptive or unrealistic. Also, individual country actions are not enough. Instead we need action that is global. But there are not functioning global institutions. Thus, we look for solutions that can be implemented at a national level, which *and* which encourage other countries to follow the lead. Such solutions should be within international laws as rules as well. We show how those potential issues can be overcome.

Because it is so important, we do not intend to raise additional revenue with this taxation source, but we do intend to ensure that the private sector has the correct incentives. To accomplish that we start with a higher carbon tax on electricity production. Electricity production should have an incentive to be carbon neutral. We achieve this with a tax on carbon inputs with a subsidy on electricity production.  Simultaneously we also provide low cost loans from the public loan board. There will be prizes for rapid rollout of new technologies and national targets for the roll out of low-carbon electricity. We have a CARBON TAX.

2) *A prosperous and wealthy country:* The second priority is a prosperous and wealthy country. The current taxation system does not encourage productive wealth formation. In fact it encourages those sorts of companies that *extract* wealth from the country and discourages those who wish to invest in the society. A better system would encourage people who invest in *real assets*, but discourage purely financial investment/ In short, a good tax system encourages a balance of trade. It discourages foreign investment in a financial sense whilst encouraging investment in a real sense. An optimal taxation system would involve a collaboration between state and the private sector, so the gains of research and development investment are shared between both. And an optimal social security system would involve some funding from sovereign wealth funds, including personal accounts, so that the people and state accumulate assets to support them in hard times.

For this we need to provide an incentive for companies like Dyson to locate into the UK. We suggest the following: a *higher* corporate tax but calculated as follows: Sales - UK Wages - UK Investment. In other words, the tax should *encourage* uk companies to invest in the UK. We call this a DYSON TAX.The financial system should be encouraged to lend to real businesses.

3) *An affordable home in a prosperous community*. The third priority is an affordable home for all. British governments have massively mismanaged the taxation of housing and business properties. By appropriately taxing the value of the location (land), in a way that is convenient and fair for all, we make it possible for most people to have the economic benefits of owning their own home. An optimal tax system would encourage community action, so that 'community entrepreneurship' allows communities to develop their value and capture the fruits of this development. How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England?  How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England? 

Well the first thing is to capture location rent increases for public causes. What does this mean? That means that the property taxes: council taxes, business rates and stamp duty should be rolled up into a single tax. This should be a tax on property with the *value* of tangible investment deductible. So that means that a house is a value, so you shouldn't be charged on this. The residual should be allocated between the local community, the municipal authority and the central government. Taxing property values rather than property per se would stabilise the current property values. We have a LAND VALUE TAX payable in cash or deferred until sale or death.

4) *Secure incomes, productive jobs and economic power:* The current social security system is highly insecure: benefits are taken away from people when their conditions change, leading them often to go into arrears with their rent or other payments, and often leading them into debt. The current social security system also discourages work, as benefits are withdrawn as income increases (in the Universal Credit system at a rate of 61% for every £ increase in income). A better benefit would not be withdrawn so rapidly as income increases, would encourage people to increase their skill level, would be well integrated with the taxation system and would also support those who enhance their communities in ways other than simply earning money (for example by caring or raising a child). It would also allow division of labour with minimal taxation between individuals in communities (so eliminating the tax advantages of being a company relative to an everyday citizen).

The fourth priority is secure incomes, productive jobs and economic power. For this, we need to simplify the existing income and means-tested benefit system. Rather than the current system of means testing benefits, there would be a single system of basic income and taxation. A 'simplifying' basic income payable to everyone in society would be combined with a simplification of the system of income taxation, so that a standard rate of 40% is applied to all income up to the point when someone reaches the top 1% of incomes. Furthermore there would be citizen wealth funds, and assets would be granted to individuals based on how much tax they paid. There would be a 'target minimum level' of wealth and individual's tax would build up this minimum level of wealth. We have a SIMPLIFIED INCOME TAX, BASIC INCOME and WEALTH FUND.

## Tax Theories of Change

How do we change a system like tax? This book deals with tax reform in two approaches. The first is a 'blank slate' approach. This considers how we would define a tax and welfare system in an ideal world where both efficiency and fairness are achieved easily. 

The second approach takes into account issues of improvement and transition. In other words, what practical politically feasible changes could be made right now to make the system more beneficial and fair?

So what does practicality look like? Often in policy, it is synonymous with political feasibility. Previously, we mentioned the idea of political realism and transitional justice. Changes must not seem both unfair and have obvious losers. Fairness will be often perceived to be a matter of *transition* as opposed to the sort of a perspective we might have when trying to create a tax system from a 'blank state' (as we do within this book). 

The tax system seems to change through top down directives, through the intervention of the chancellor of the exchequer of the time. This approach means that the tax system often changes with the agenda of 'budget day' announcements. Of course,the secrecy around these announcements is to a degree necessary: if agents know how the tax system is going to change, then they may be able to take steps to avoid the taxes. A better approach would be to conduct a strategic tax review, much in a similar way to the strategic defence review.

Any discussion of taxation and welfare needs to consider *political realism*. What is political realism? It's recognising that some policies are politically easier to implement than others. In the context of taxation and welfare, we need to consider *transitional justice* and in particular not make any major groups worse off (except those that had previously benefitted unfairly). So, for example, it might be argued that a 100% land value tax is appropriate in certain locations, but to impose such a tax immediately would be unfair on those people who had recently purchased a house in the last year in a high land value area.

So what would it take to make change happen? I argue here that we need:

1. Political desire for change, a broad public consensus that there is a wrong that needs to be righted.
2. A shared narrative understanding of the principles on which any new plan might be based
3. Proposals that people could rally around
4. Communication of this plan 
5. An opportunity
6. People ready to take advantage of this opportunity when it does arise.

How do we create that narrative? Well, this book is a contribution to it. It is very important to build a narrative that works for everyone in society and caters to the different ways that people live in the world and contribute to their economic lives.

The first principle of the Beveridge report was that 'revolutionary times need revolutions not patching'. We do not at present have the luxury of a fresh start. But we are starting to live in revolutionary times. Tax and welfare justice and simplification and their benefits in tackling great challenges facing us are, we suggest, good places to start. This book aims to provide some policies to help escape from a possible hell of environmental destruction and inequality. It gives us the means to complete Smith's goal of widely shared prosperity in a beautiful and secure planetary home. And it shows that our responsibility to our nation and our planet is not only personal but also political. We seek a Tax Heaven to preserve what we have, and to ensure a more heavenly future. Our quest is to search for tax heaven, that is a tax and social security system that is beneficial, practical and fair.  In order to achieve that, In order to predict the effects of the tax system, we will need to expostulate a theory of how the economy works. We will need to define in turn the benefits as well as the costs that could come from a tax system. We will need to work the a system that is practical, and just.  In order to actually change the tax system, we will need to develop a theory of how political change might happen. Finally we will need to work out how realistically how we can get from where we are today to where we wish to be.**

We must reclaim our minds and awaken to the story we have been told about how the economy works. We must see the evidence of the consequences, and realise that there are alternatives. We must start to tell a new story. 

## Previous Frameworks and Guidelines for Successful Reform

According to Bird and Oldman [-@BirdAndOldman] there are eleven main aspects that need to be considered for a successful tax reform. In this section we take Bird and Oldman's categories, and specify them for this particular book, in the order that they are covered in this book:     

1. *Taxation theory*: Taxing rent and externalities, taking account of the theory of optimal taxation (both its classical formulation and the recent additions).   
2. Macroeconomic situation*: Balance of payments, trade deficit.   
3. *Attractiveness of proposals to politicians and voters*: A reform should be attractive to voters and to specific politician types. There should also be feasible policy pathways to achieving the reform. 
4. *Political realities*: Interest of voter groups, popular notions justice, Interest of powerful groups.
5. *Institutional inertia*: Capture proposals for overcoming this.     
6. *Administrative realities*: Including the existing tax system, making taxes easily calculable, and making the system as automatic as possible.     
7. *Empirical evidence*, for example: effect of incentives at work; Interaction between work, experience, education and salary; effect of environmental taxes on damage; effect of health taxes on health outcomes; effect of taxes on finance.   
8. *Robustness to changing times*: We look at the changing nature of work, and consider the dynamic effects of our tax proposals. 
9. Local knowledge*: Legal nature of tax system; specific problems of UK system tax and economy (regional balances, dysfunctional house prices etc.).      
10. Produce beneficial results: See modelling chapter.

## **Feasibility of proposals**

Malcolm Torry in his recent book 'The feasibility of citizen's income' [@Torry2016], considers desirability of an unconditional per capita payment to all citizens and then distinguishes between, and analyses, seven different types of 'feasibility':

1. Fiscal
2. Household financial
3. Psychological
4. Administrative
5. Behavioural
6. Political
7. Policy process
   We cover these notions of feasibility in our evaluation of these proposals in part 14.

## Plan of the Book

This chapter considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasizing where our ideas are new or innovative. . 

Chapter 2 considers economic reform and economic justice in history, starting with Adam Smith.

Chapter 3 outlines the principles of the Beveridge report. Like Beveridge, we want to produce a *radical, comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

Chapters 4 and 5 build a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the major important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. [To Be Implemented: Empirically we should ask the hypothetical question: *how would the world be different if this or that assumption were true*. We then use quantitative data to see which assumption is appropriate.]

Chapter 6 considers the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. *Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing any tax or system of taxation. Each covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions. It defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, good and practical tax system. 

Chapter 7 builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to fairly transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Chapter 8-14, consider the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality seems to be driven not only by difference in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation.  Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sector, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them. We then apply these ideas to the sectors of the economy.

Chapter 15 and 16, contain our proposals and the quantitative modelling work on them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented.  We outline our proposals model them and conclude the book in part 14. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.
