# PART 13: PROPOSALS

# 13.1 Overview

In this book we have compared the Tax and Welfare system to an operating system; a mechanism of levers through which society is run, funds are raised, and public services are delivered. Using this metaphor, we have been able to troubleshoot the bugs in the current system and illustrate why the UK has seen increasing inequality of outcomes for the best and the worst off in our society. 

We have an unwieldy, overly complex tax and welfare system in which the rich get richer, while those on the bottom see their income and wealth stagnate. By delivering benefits on a means-tested basis, our benefit system doesn't encourage re-entering employment.

Early on in this book we outlined the framework we choose to structure the evaluation of the UK tax system, by building on Beveridge's work in fighting his five great evils of society. These guiding principles structure our analysis. We argue for a tax system that is fair, and lead to greater equality of opportunity amongst its members. It should be beneficial and contribute to the sustainable and ethical development of a society. Finally such a system should be practical in its administration and application. 

Taxes, amongst their other roles of nudging incentives and redistributing income, are predominately aimed at financing public provision of goods and services - including welfare for the most needy in society. Therefore, we emphasise that these three balls need to be balanced carefully so as to ensure that the UK's Tax and Welfare system helps us build the society that we aim to achieve.

Discussed extensively in the book, it's important to summarise the findings from our discussion. These are expanded upon below. Broadly, on the whole, we plan to simplify the income tax and benefit system, and augment taxes where there is a social outcome that needs to be achieved through discouraging negative behaviour. A comprehensive Land Value Tax (LVT) would be phased in, so as to ensure that land was successfully developed, and any excess rent could be captured and that windfall redistributed.

Our proposals below should be considered interim, since we have not yet completed accurate modelling of all their effects.

# 13.2 The Mirrlees Review

Our starting point in building our proposals were the recommendations of the Mirrlees review [@Mirrlees2010]. This document suggested a number of key reforms of the UK tax system, so as to create effective incentives for a better functioning society. It also discussed different approaches to the taxation of income invested, with particular reference to whether whether gains or the final consumption are taxed. The review does not cover the benefit system. The recommendations of the summary reportare as follows:

1. Replace Business Rates with a Land Value Tax
2. Reform Council tax (and transactions) into a single simple tax on property.
3. Remove exemptions from VAT and refund by increases in benefits and allowances
4. Introduce congestion charging
5. Rationalise the approach to greenhouse gas (carbon) taxation
6. Remove transaction taxes (stamp duties) as highly economically distorting.
7. Introduce a consistent approach for dealing with the VAT exception of financial services (especially when bundled with other services)
8. Simplify where possible.
9. Introduce an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to eliminate the favouring of debt financing over equity.

We use these proposals to guide our own recommendations for new policies. 

# 13.3 Philosophy of Our Proposals

In this section we explain the guiding philosophy behind our proposals, and define a simple set of proposals that may help achieve an ideal taxation system. The guiding principles here are that the system will be beneficial, fair, and practical.

## Beneficiaries

Our new tax system considers the citizens of the UK to be akin to the 'shareholders' of a company, with a stake in the outcome of the country. These citizens are therefore the intended beneficiaries of the tax system. The 'paying customers' of this system should be the property owners, particularly the owners of UK land and anyone profiting from, or otherwise building wealth by selling goods and services to, UK consumers. This also should apply to those individuals/organisations which are otherwise receiving payments from the UK. The tax system should charge them for this benefit received.

## Changing Incentives

Income, Wealth and Environmental Damage of Consumption should be taxed. Personal Incomes are already adequately taxed, while Wealth and Environmental Damages are not. The main goal of our wealth taxation proposals is to tax the top 1% (and particularly the top 0.1%) by wealth. This can be achieved by taxing all forms of wealth, with allowances/subsidies granted to those who remain resident in the UK. We also propose to properly regulate environmental damage through the application of a Carbon tax, which should help incentivise more sustainable consumer behaviour. 

## Avoiding Avoidance

Under the new system, you would receive *tax benefits* from residing in the UK. Land is an inelastic base of taxation, as it is unable to be moved, and alongside the profits from consumption by UK customers. Non resident foreigners who own UK assets will be treated in an equivalent way to the UK super rich - with high levels of taxation applied to their UK holdings. 

## Simplicity is key

The tax system should be as simple as possible. Thus we simplify wherever possible. Moreover, where and if there are options for making the tax system automatic, we should take them. This system should not need or involve any 'self assessment', which can often act as an extra barrier to engaging fully with the system.

## Privacy and Transparency

The new tax system should have privacy for ordinary members of the public. That could be achieved by the assignment of secure identities to taxpayers which are independent of their real identity (so that name or address would be separately stored than the 'tax' identity). This would ensure the safety of the citizens of the UK. There may however be a case made for the complete transparency of the very rich (0.1% by wealth or income) and major companies. This would be part of a check-and-balance mechanism is in place to regulate political and financial influence within the UK.

# 13.4 Institutional Reforms

## Residency Allowance

As mentioned above, the new tax system would shift incentives to ensure that there were strong tax benefits to maintaining UK residency (i.e. a residency allowance). This would replace tax benefits for offshore or non-dom status. The super rich and the offshore resident owners would therefore be treated equivalently, with steep tax rates,  unless the offshore residents reside in a trusted partner country with good disclosure mechanisms on taxable assets (e.g. an EU country).

## Local Taxation

Taxes on housing should be transformed over time into a 100% Land Value Tax, plus a wealth allowance. The exact size of this wealth allowance could be decided by local authorities. Local authorities would therefore be funded by a progressive land wealth tax. Any uplift in land rental values should be distributed 50-50 between local authorities and national authorities. This LVT could be adjusted for the effect of any infrastructure investments on land values, where 100% of the uplift would be captured by the authority making the investment. 

## Strategic Tax Reform

Instead of having an annual budget, the tax system should be treated strategically. In other words, it would be run much like the strategic spending and defence review - namely a 'strategic tax review'.

# 13.5 Transitional Questions

To ensure that these new proposals are implemented successfully, any transition to the new taxation system would need to to account for the following three effects. 

1) First the transition must be *practical* and *simple* to understand.
2) Second the transition should be, and be seen to be, *fair*.
3) Third the transition should be seen to be *beneficial* in the short term as well as the long term.

Asset value effects are important in this. These are important both from the fairness persective and from the perspective of economic benefit. Volatile rises and falls in asset values are arguably unfair -rises because the people who receive these rises are not necessarily deserving of it; and likewise for any falls. Both of these impacts can be amplificed through ineffective application of government policy. For example, two major government policies -not revaluing Council tax and reductions in long term interest rates - have caused national house price increases.

# 13.6 Options for Taxes on Personal Income

Income Tax and National Insurance together account for around half of all revenue raised. These taxes are likely to be important for the foreseeable future. Income tax is important as a tax on wage income and on income from investments.  It is also the primary means of affecting the distribution of income using the tax system. However the existing approach is, like the rest of the tax system, unnecessary complex. Income tax, and its close cousin National Insurance (which we combine into a single tax) are also extremely efficient ways of raising revenue.

At present, the wage income is largely deducted at source in the 'Pay as You Earn' (PAYE) system. This means that companies administer the payment of income tax. They know how much tax to deduct because every individual has a tax code. The tax code indicates whether the taxpayer pays basic or higher rate tax. 

Some income does not fall under PAYE for example: dividend income. It is impractical for a company to know all the tax codes of its shareholders. Thus, income from dividends needs to be declared by individuals at the end of the tax year alongside income tax paid by the individual concerned. At present, corporation tax is paid on profits, and the income tax paid on dividend income is reduced by an equivalent amount to compensate. 

## Simplification Options

We can distinguish between tax simplification and the addition of a basic income.

First, lets look at tax simplification. We can simplify the tax code through the following procedure. First put the income tax and NI system together for earned income, and apply the same rates to unearned income as earned income. Then, you would consider the top rates of tax (Income Tax + NI). We keep these as they are now, and then apply it to lower tax bands. At the same time increase the personal allowance. The two procedures can ensure that nobody pays more tax on their earned income than they do at present. 

- Option 1 is this zero-high rate system (ie a large personal allowance plus a top rate)
- Option 2 is the same system, but with a low rate (no personal allowance) plus a high rate. A small basic income can be added.
- Option 3 is a basic income plus the high rate flat tax

With a flat system, everyone faces the same tax rate. There is no need for a separate tax code for each individual. All income can thus be taxed at source. This would also brings the taxation of dividends into the income tax system, which would therefore mean there is no need for a corporation tax on the part of company profits hich is paid out as dividends. We still, however, need a tax on retained earnings.

The disadvantage of a flat tax system is that it is less progressive than the other system.

## Conclusions

We propose to combine the current National Insurance and Income Tax systems so that there is a single tax on income. We also propose to simplify the rate structure so that there is only one rate above the allowance. Having a single rate allows the tax system to be made considerably simpler, and permits taxes to be deducted at source.

# 13.7 Overview of Possibilities for Taxing Wealth 

## Source-based Private Wealth Taxes

In general, we prefer to recommend source-based wealth taxes rather than residence based taxes. In other words, we propose to tax income-generating assets located in the UK. The advantage of this approach is that these assets are typically less mobile than the individual. This reduces the risk of tax avoidance. However, there may be a case for an internationally coordinated residence tax as well. 

## Residence-based Private Wealth Taxes

Because of the source-based wealth taxes we have suggested above, such a tax would not need to be set as stringently. However, risk of avoidance by the rich may be high because of their access to skilled legal advice and mechanisms to move their assets to the most advantageous locations. It may therefore be necessary to impose an international residence-based wealth tax.

We propose to consult with European and other partners so as to put in place an internationally coordinated wealth tax. The objective would be to ensure that the richest in society do not get richer faster. As outlined in previous chapters, the increased rate of growth in wealth as compared to the growth in average incomes contributes to the compounding of inequality. For a variety of reasons, this is not a desirable outcome. To that end, we aim to form a coalition with other countries to promote transparency, and create a single coordinated residence wealth tax. However, getting international agreement consensus on such a policy would be difficult and time consuming, and so should not be relied upon.

## Conclusions

We will apply a source based approach which minimises the possibilities for avoidance, including a land value tax.

# 13.8 Taxes on Corporate Profit

We propose the reform of the corporation tax system. Our goal is a system of company taxation that rewards exporting companies and all those that invest in physical capital expenditure in the UK. We also want to find a solution that avoids the'race to the bottom' mentality of international corporate tax rates. Here, we suggest a reform of the VAT and existing corporation tax system that achieves just that. Our proposal here is to unify VAT and corporation tax under a company cash flow tax. 

A corporation tax is a tax on company profits. It generally covers both profits retained within the company (retained earnings) and those paid out as dividends (distributed earnings). A credit is applied to distributed earnings so tax is only paid once. But should we have a corporate tax at all? Since companies are owned by individuals, might it not be simpler to tax individuals rather than companies?  

What, in fact, is the purpose of the Corporation Tax system? It functions as an at-source tax on company profits made in the UK. It therefore has a few purposes:

- To tax foreigners on profits made in the UK and so mitigate the flow of wealth overseas from for example monopolies owned by foreign owners.
- To prevent companies being used as tax free savings devices.
- To ensure that companies pay a fair share of the cost for the government services provided to the company (eg. enforcement of property rights, education of the workforce, health care provision).

Some options for corporation tax then that ensure that these aims are upheld are listed as follows:

- Publicly quoted companies should have the option to pay the cash flow tax in shares. These shares would accrue to a sovereign wealth fund which would pay the Citizen's Dividend.
- A 'monopoly charge' of 5% of the company value (proportional to value added sold to UK consumers,i.e. like VAT) would be imposed on all large companies and on trusts. This tax would be payable in shares to a sovereign wealth fund for children, so that1/20th of the shares of a company or trust would go to such a fund per year.
- International wealth transparency tax of 0.1% of assets greater than 5 million pounds
- Capital Gains Tax: If the tax paid on retained earnings is less than the average tax paid on dividends, company owners will have an incentive to retain those earnings within the company. The owner of the shares could later sell them. They would therefore pay less tax than if the earnings had been paid out as dividends. Capital gains tax on
shares ownership can be thought of as a crude way to prevent tax avoidance through this route. Capital gains tax also allows those who have achieved unearned capital value increases (for example, due to the fall in long-term interest rates) to contribute properly. Capital gains tax rates should be set consistently to
avoid tax advantages or disadvantages based on legal structure. 
- Applying an Immigration and Citizenship charge

## Proposals 

We propose to replace Corporation Tax and VAT with a 'cash flow' tax and taxation at source of all dividends. Whereas a corporation tax is a tax on 'economic profit', a cash flow tax is a tax on net receipts (i.e. retained cash flow). Cash-flow is a destination basis corporate tax, exempting exporters, capital investment and R&D but including interest payments. The basis of the cash flow tax is UK sales and borrowing minus costs, dividends, interest and principal repayments. It therefore exempts capital expenditure and exports. It is similar to a value added tax, where wage expenditures are deductible. The advantage of the cash flow tax is that can be applied to the financial sector and it encourages investment and exporters. With corporation tax, companies can move the jurisdiction they are registered in, and charge losses to high-tax locations and profits to low tax locations. With a cash flow tax, all sales in the UK are taxed, and only UK wage payments are deductible. It applies to all companies that sell in the UK, and 'transfer pricing' becomes irrelevant. It avoids the international 'race to the bottom' among corporate tax rates.


# 13.9 Taxes on Land and Property
  
Because land is fixed in supply, it can be taxed without causing significant economic distortion. A land tax subtracts the value of the premises from the tax on the land itself. It can be imposed progressively, reducing the return to landownership (capital gain plus rent) to around a zero nominal return.

The implementation of a land value tax can be achieved in two main ways. Firstly, a simple tax on land values and secondly, the public ownership of land combined with short-term lease sales. The successful city states of East Asia: Hong Kong and Singapore, adopt one of these two options. Hong Kong, due to the new territories being originally leased from China to Britain, never had private land ownership simply because the land was to be returned to China eventually. So the government of Hong Kong receives a large part of its revenue in the sale of leases of 20 or 30 years term. 

This tax is best introduced in 3 separate ways:

1. Implementation as a national replacement for as many existing taxes as possible (council tax, stamp duty land tax, inheritance tax on land, TV license fee, etc.).
2. Use of this tax as a macroeconomic stabilizer (the bank of England could increment this tax in order to avoid propose and to ensure that real terms house prices decline gradually to more reasonable levels).
3. Introduction of 'land value covenants', similar to 'government mortgages' but with the interest paid proportional to local land values. Those who have difficulty paying the tax(for example because they are asset rich or income poor) would have the option to roll up the tax into an indefinite 'interest payment' index to the value of the land.
4. Some time threshold for any residual freehold ownership (e.g. 99 years).

A land value tax on built up land would take the total value of the property and subtract the value of the building. Both values are easily assessed: for example there are multiple websites accessing overall property value. The advantage of subtracting property value is also that beautiful and historic buildings, and those that contribute to the character of areas can be recognize as such. This subsidy on building size would work well as a way to mitigate the increase of fossil fuel taxes on household energy bills.


# 13.10 Environmental, Fossil Fuel and Congestion Taxes

Some economic activity causes significant harm to people or the environment, for example:

- overfishing
- pollution (such as greenhouse emissions)
- congestion (caused by driving at rush-hour)
- smoking
- consumption of high levels of sugar or salt.

We propose to tax these abuses and behaviours. For example, we propose that a greenhouse gas  emissions tax should be imposed. Such a tax should avoid making industry in the UK uncompetitive so it should be taxed on a consumption basis (i.e. based only on UK sales, wherever they are produced). This tax can be implemented upstream on fossil fuel extraction and import and on embodied emissions in imports. It should refund taxes paid on exports. The refund for a good being exported and the tariff on the same good being imported need to be the same, to prevent import-export tax arbitrage. Other taxes should be imposed according to similar principles.

Moving specifically to fossil fuels, there are four main reasons for fuel taxes: 
1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
2. Resource Rent
3 Costs of Roads, Airports and other Infrastructure
4. Congestion i.e. use of Road Space
5. Environmental and Health Damage
2-4 are dealt with under 'Environmental taxes'. We just consider resource rents here.

## Carbon Tax

Carbon dioxide,methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs, SF6 and other gases cause global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification: the reduction in pH of the upper oceans. The likely magnitude and severity of these global effects is somewhat uncertain but likely to be severe in the long term. CO2 is produced on combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum and coal). 

We propose that carbon tax should replace existing taxes on fossil fuels (except road fuel duty). It should be implemented 'upstream' on imports and extraction of fossil fuel according to carbon content. Rather than a slow increase in carbon tax rates we suggest implementing revenue neutral reform that compensates losers. 

Summary of aspects of tax on greenhouse gas emissions: 

1. Tax upstream: tax precursors like fossil fuels as they enter the country
2. Tax base should be consumption,not production 

Upstream taxation is about the administration of the tax. Carbon is conserved so every molecule of CO2 relates to a single atom of carbon in the original fuel.Hence, a CO2 tax is also a carbon tax. CO2 can therefore be taxed on the carbon content of the original fuel. In general greenhouse should be taxed 'upstream' on relevant precursors if possible because it's usually simpler that way; and this is always the case with carbon/carbon dioxide.

Most proposals for carbon taxes focus on the production of greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions. However, if one taxes the production of GHG emissions, it will encourage industry to move to those locations which have low emissions taxes. We therefore propose to tax consumption instead, so the tax base would be all greenhouse gas emissions produced as a result of British consumers' activity. This tax base would then include products manufactured overseas and consumed by British citizens. Therefore, to implement an upstream carbon tax with a consumption base requires adjustments at borders. These adjustments need to tax imports and exempt exports from the carbon tax. 

There are two types of adjustments that could be made on imports. The first would neutralise the effect of the tax while not discriminating between different countries with different emissions. The second option makes a distinction between the efficiency of different countries and the emissions they produce. We propose at present the first and less aggressive option.This is intended to neutralise the competitiveness effect of the domestic tax. It is not necessarily to distinguish between products made in different countries, hence, it is not intended to be an aggressive trade policy. 

There should be an adjustment on exports and imports. Only UK consumers should be taxed. So all products that are consumed in the UK are going to be taxed. 

CO2 produced during the manufacturing process of a product needs to be estimated and the tax on the product must be proportional to CO2 emissions.

To make this concept more tangible, we can make an example for UK-made steel. The CO2 produced per kg for this product can be estimated. A corresponding amount would be charged on imports and the same amount would be refunded on exports. For products that are not manufactured in the UK, tariff can be estimated based on general estimation of how much CO2 is produced in making that good. 

Exports would be exempted from the tax. However, since the tax is charged upstream on import and extraction of fossil fuels, a system of refunding similar to VAT needs to be in place. However, the refund for a good being exported and the tariff on the same good being imported need to be the same, to prevent import-export tax arbitrage. 

## Resource Rents

So unlike in countries without resources where the incentives are to work hard and produce valuable products, in resource-rich countries, the incentives are to be powerful enough to control the resources. This is called the resource curse and we can see that those regions which contain great oil reserves also contain repressive regimes and political instability.Furthermore, high resource rents  involve a transfer of money from consuming to producing countries which is against the interest of the consuming countries. Therefore, it would be in consumers' interests to reduce the rent by limiting consumption of oil through taxes and other measures. 

Resource rent taxes can be charged both by consumers and by producers. In that way there is competition between the two. There is already a tax on profits from extraction of north sea oil and an aggregates levy. These should be retained.

There could also be a rents tax on oil imposed by coordinated internationally between oil-consuming countries. We propose an internationally-coordinated tax on oil consumption. This should be increased to reduce the open-market price of oil. Such a tax is essential to reduce new exploration and the environmental damage it may cause. It would also reduce trade deficits. Taxes on extraction of oil should be retained. In principle they should include extraction of any other high-rent natural resources, although oil appears to be the only relevant natural resource in the case of the UK. Such taxes should be coordinated between oil-consuming countries. Also, tackling climate change requires that fossil fuels are no longer extracted. In order for this to happen, the value of those fossil fuels on the open market needs to be low or zero. In other words, the rent needs to be captured by taxes in the consuming countries. A resource rent tax is, in effect, a land value taxon resource rents which would otherwise be captured overseas.  

## Land use and Maintenance Costs

Typically, roads are provided free at the point of use by the government for all car and other users to enjoy. In the UK, there's only one toll road (and a few toll bridges);all other costs are paid by the government. However, the revenue raised by fuel and vehicle taxes is more than a cost of roads so this taxes are revenue raising and behaviour changing more than just a cost of the infrastructure.

## Congestion Charges

Cars travelling at peak times take up limited road space and prevent other car users from reaching their destination in a timely fashion. Road fuel taxes can be seen as implicitly charging for congestion; however, they do so highly imperfectly (because congestion and its cost are concentrated very specific times and places which do not constitute a large proportion of the fuel use)and so we suggest a separate congestion charge. 

We propose to adjust the existing road tax to become a congestion charge. This would work on a tax and rebate system. Everyone would pay the charge but people would have the option to have a black box in their car which would prove through acceleration, location or time that the driver was not driving in a congested area. Every day that the vehicle was not in congestion would be refunded from the overall tax.

## Other Local Pollution Taxes

Burning fossil fuels causes both global and local environmental problems. In addition, burning oil products in cars causes health problems and car travel is relatively dangerous. A tax on fuel is a way of paying for those costs. 
Additional local pollution caused by coal, for example SO2, soot (including PM10s), needs to be controlled by taxes or tradable permits. 


# 13.11 Food And Sin Taxes

## Alcohol and Tobacco

Alcohol and tobacco taxes would be retained as today. There may be a case for harmonisation across Europe, to prevent 'booze cruises'.

## Sugar Tax on Processed and Prepared Food

Excess sugar intake causes multiple health problems including obesity, type-II diabetes and tooth decay. We propose a simple sugar tax on the manufacture or importation of sugar based on three categories of sugar-like compounds. 

- Class A: 'sugar' (i.e., sucrose, glucose and fructose), including contents of fruit juice. 
- Class B: 'near sugar', including maltose etc. and synthetic and natural sweeteners with unclear health impacts.
- Class C: 'unprocessed' sugars in raw fruit and vegetables; starch and other carbohydrates.

Class A would have 100% tax (ie. £0.01 or 1p per gram sugar); class B, 50%  (ie. 0.5 pence per gram sugar); and class C 0%.

## Salt Tax on Processed and Prepared Food

We propose a simple salt tax on processed foods. This would be charged according to salt content.


# 13.12: Options For Welfare System

The present benefit system is a mixture of unconditional, conditional, means-tested, taxable and non-taxable payments. It is illogical and ill-thought through. Additionally,different means-tested benefits are means tested in different ways. The sum total of the system creates perverse incentives and does not encourage work effectively. Indeed, dealing with the benefits system is like a job in itself,both for the person claiming benefits and for the people administering benefits. This complexity is unnecessary because means-testing is just a tax in disguise: it takes away money from people as wages increase. Such a function is best performed by the income tax system, which also takes away money from people as wages increase. 

We propose a return to universal benefits with 'means testing' performed by the income tax system, rather than the benefits system, in an integrated and smooth way. The basic universal benefit in our proposed system is the Citizen's Dividend. It is a universal payment to all UK citizens. The Citizen's Dividend is a per capita payment to all citizens of the country, paid regardless of employment status. It is a universal payment to everyone in society who is a citizen of the UK. The payment would be initially equal to current income support levels, i.e, around £75 a week, or £3800 per year. 

There will be different rates for children (replacing child benefit and child tax credit, paid to mothers), working-age adults (replacing income support) and pensioners (equivalent to the existing state pension). It provides all UK citizens with the minimum amount of income. We also propose to offset payment of Citizen's Dividend against other taxes so taxpayers only receive a net bill or payment.

In addition, there will need to be further payments for particular categories of people with specific needs -- for example, disabled people, the elderly, carers and mothers with children. We propose that these payments would be made on a similar and consistent basis to the Citizen's Dividend described above. There will obviously need to be changes to the tax system in order to pay for these universal benefits but the system of government accounting should account for a means-tested benefit and a taxable universal benefit with increased income taxes the same way.

We also propose to offset payment of Citizen's Dividend against taxes. This would specifically apply to those taxes that are highly visible such as property taxes, so that individuals will receive or pay only the net amount of either taxes or benefits. 

## Basic Income 

This section describes the Citizens Income (a.k.a. Basic Income; Citizens Dividend) and a couple of ways that it could be introduced. The citizens Income is a per capita payment to all citizens of the country, paid regardless of employment status. It is intended to simplify the tax-benefit system; rather than means testing,the rest of the tax system is used to tax away the benefit. This Citizens Income provides everyone in the society with a minimum amount of income to live on. It's a way of compensating people for the inevitable costs resulting from the scarcity of natural things that are vital to life. The level of the Citizen's income might be, for example, around £75 per week, or around £3800per year. 

The citizen's income pays scarcity rents. If the fundamental things in life were not scarce for example if there were an infinite amount of land to grow food and live on and if the atmosphere was completely unlimited then there would be no need for a citizens income, just as there is no citizens income for the hunter-gatherer.In principle then, the citizens income compensates man for that which he loses when and he multiplies and lives in cities rather than being in the wild and living as a hunter gather. 

A Citizens income can be introduced as a simplification of the existing tax and benefit system.It would be paid from the tax department and replaces some existing benefits.It could be taxed away using income tax, so maxing explicit the effective taxes implicit in means testing, and allowing those rates to be smoothed and optimised. Also, as you increase taxes that the unemployed do not pay, also introduce a citizens income and net off the two. People with tax bills would only receive a net tax bill.

Our goal for the value of the Citizen's Dividend is the current level of income support.  We would abolish this benefit and replace it with a Citizen's Dividend paid to all. However, since the introduction of this dividend is expensive, it may need implementing slowly. For simplicity and political purposes, the dividend should be netted off against taxes paid, for example on property and land. Hence, people will receive only the net benefit or pay the net tax. 

## Integrated Skills Training-Workfare Schemes

The ideal education and welfare system include not only a (low) citizens income, around the current level of income support but also an integrated training, entrepreneurship and workfare scheme. The workfare system would be a system that pays a small wage but also develops the claimant's skill-set. This is also the purpose of some further education courses. Integrating workfare with training allows continual upgrading of the skill-set. Such training should always prepare the recipient both for employment and for entrepreneurship/self-employment. For example,mini-economies can be created in schools and universities to allow older school children to trade between themselves. The training-workfare college should develop these entrepreneurial skills further, removing one major barrier to entry to all industries, a general lack of entrepreneurial skills.

# 13.13 Simple Policy Proposals

This section proposes a simple tax system which aims to fulfills our requirements of being beneficial, fair and practical. These proposed policies, and the related transitional arrangements, aim to resolve issues around incentives and redistribution in the current UK tax system in a politically achievable way. 

## Main Taxes

1. Replace Business Rates and Council tax with a norm-based LVT consisting of a 100% LVT on increases in land rent. Transition the residual tax to a tax on land wealth.
2. Replace VAT and Corporation tax with a 'Dyson' Tax (Cashflow Tax) with half deductability for imports from VAT compliant non-tax havens.  
3. Introduce a corporate wealth tax on the same principles as the Dyson tax (i.e. combined with a witholding tax on payments abroad from the UK) 
4. Introduce a layered upstream consumption based Carbon Incentive. Transition this over time to an upstream Consumption based Carbon Tax plus Citizen's Dividend.
5. Simplify Income Tax and NI with a simple progressive income tax system with a very simple rate structure. (The exact details of the rate structure and basic income depend on accurate modelling of the tax system)

## Benefits

1. Replace unemployment benefit with a payment by results conditional work-training hybrid
2. Slowly introduce a citizen's dividend as a compensating payment for additional consumption taxes.
3. Pay for housing benefit automatically out of LVT.
4. Retain other benefits, but fold all means testing into the income tax system, with maximum means testing amount equal to the tax paid on the personal allowance
5. Once this is acheived it is easy, if required, to abolish all personal allowances and replace the whole system with a basic income with additional payments conditional on disability/carer/age status.

## Further minor taxes

1. Introduce congestion charges in lieu of a carbon tax on transport fuels.
2. Introduce comprehensive environmental and health taxation (packaging tax, sugar, meat tax, and others if needed).
3. Increase the bank balance sheet tax and adapt it counter-cyclically and alter it to favour lending to real businesses.
4. Introduce a comprehensive wealth register. This may take the form of a disclosure requirement on all UK wealth owned by foreigners and on ownership of foreign wealth by uk residents. Combine with a small 0.1% wealth tax on both of these classes of wealth.
