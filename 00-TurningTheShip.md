# PART 1: Turning The Ship

The film 'A Perfect Storm' describes the true story of a fishing trawler facing an epic storm. 

A group of New England fishermen had fallen on hard times after poor catches. Their captain, played by George Clooney, hired a boat for one last fishing trip of the year.

The trawler sailed out into the mid-Atlantic. After much fruitless searching, they finally struck fish. Turning for home, they hoped to get the catch back whilst still fresh. 

Unfortunately, a storm was brewing, and not just any storm. Three separate weather systems had merged to create a 'weather bomb' of unusual intensity. Meteorologists warned of a serious threat to life. 

The fishermen faced a dilemma. Should they attempt to land their catch whilst still fresh? To do so, they would need to risk their lives by sailing back, straight through the storm. Or they could avoid the storm by sailing further out to sea. After this detour, the fish would no longer [be] fresh and they would be out of pocket.

Added to this dilemma were communication and leadership issues. The storm had damaged the radio, making it difficult to get information or call for help. The captain (we will call him 'Clooney'), whilst charismatic, lacked good judgment. He took the risk and sailed into the storm.

Taking a step back from their immediate plight, it seems odd that Clooney and his men took such a severe risk. Why were they in that situation in the first place? Perhaps, there are two reasons.

First, the seas were no longer as plentiful as they once were. In the 1950s, the Grand Banks off Newfoundland teemed with fish. But overfishing led to a collapse in stocks. Thus our crew needed to go further out to sea, where more bountiful stocks remained.

Second, the fishermen lacked economic security in their lives. They had to fish to keep food on the table. Beyond their own homes, they owned little. The boat was owned by an investor who expected a return and did nothing so dangerous as to head out to sea.



What has the Perfect Storm got to do with the future of the planet? On Earth, we are facing a similar situation to Clooney's character and his crew. There are warnings of a dangerous future for us all. Climate scientists warn of a much hotter planet with more intense storms and rising seas. Should we ignore the warnings like Clooney, or accept the dangers we face?

But even if we accept the warnings, our situation is tricky. You and I don't control the direction of the world economy. There is no single captain of the good ship Earth. Most of us have little idea how the controls of our economy work. 



This book is about a particular set of controls that direct our economy -- taxation. In this book, we show how to change the tax system to direct the economy to a brighter future. The book also links taxation to other matters such as welfare benefits, property rights, wealth accumulation, environment, energy and housing policy.

A heckler might argue that our interests and actions are our own business. People should be free to do what they want, without the government directing them. Anyway, hasn't the market economy had a good record? We are richer, more secure, and have a lower risk of death than previous times. Poverty is also lower than it was in the past. 

But there are storm clouds on the horizon. This book investigates two major issues that threaten our future.

The first is environmental damage. The richer and more populous humanity is, the more environmental damage we cause. Unless we learn better habits, we will damage the one planet that we have.

The second is economic insecurity. Young people are working harder just to stay still. In the 1950s, a single wage earner on average wages could afford to buy their own home in London. [ADD STATS HERE] These days, a couple might never get out of renting. [ADD STATS HERE].

Related, is our third and final issue: how to make the change together. The members of Clooney's crew had different preferences. Some wanted to get home swiftly, others wanted to stay out at sea and avoid the storm. But the fate of the crew was closely linked. Nobody had the choice to exit the boat early. They had to decide together and thus live -- or die -- together. The fate of humanity is similar. Whatever our individual preferences are, we also face issues in common. We need to understand the controls of our economy so we can direct our economy and our world in a safer direction. 


The trawler and the fishermen combine a mechanical system and a human one. It mattered not only how well the boat was working but also how well Clooney was working. So it is with our economy and the political system that guides it.  


This book grapples with both economic and political issues. 

The economic question is this: Why is there pollution and economic insecurity amidst such wealth? Is there a remedy to these ills? 

The political question is this: How can we change course together? 

We are in the same boat.

# Plan of the Book

Chapter 1B considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasising when our ideas are new or innovative. 

Chapter 1C defines a new economic model. It defines the economic objective as preserving and enhancing genuine wealth rather than activity and defines wealth at four levels.

Chapter 2A considers economic reform and economic justice in history, starting with Adam Smith. It introduces the Adam Smith model of economic growth and distribution.

Chapter 2B outlines the principles of the Beveridge report. Like Beveridge, we want to produce a *radical and comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

Chapter 3 builds a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal, we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the most important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. 

Chapter 4 builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes, we seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such as climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Chapter 5 considers tax in principle. It considers the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. *Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing any tax or system of taxation. Each category covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions. It defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, beneficial and practical tax system. 

Chapter 6 considers tax in practice. We look in detail at tax avoidance.

Chapters 7-12 consider the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality is driven not only by differences in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation. Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sectors, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them.

Chapters 13-15 contain our proposals and our quantitative modelling of them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.
