# PART 2: TAX AND WELFARE IN HISTORY

# 2-1: Revolutions in the Minds of Men

UNDER THE STARRY SKIES, far away from the everyday hustling and bustling of the commercial metropolis, sits a professor, beavering away at his manuscript. The year is 1773; the location, Kirkaldy, a small town in Scotland; the author, Adam Smith. The full title of Smith's great work would be 'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'.

On this cool and starry night, Smith was writing the fifth and final book of the 'Wealth of Nations', entitled 'On the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth'. Smith asked, 'how should the activity of the government be funded?'. Which taxes should a state impose?

This book is devoted to similar questions: how should we fund the state? Which taxes should be levied and why? And relatedly, what would make a better welfare system? We use taxation and welfare firstly as tools to  enhance the wealth of the planet, of nations, of communities and of individuals. By wealth, we mean the stock of valuable things, including the environment and individuals. And we are concerned also to distribute wealth fairly, partly by ensuring that wealth does not beget more wealth unless it is productively invested, and partly by ensuring that the transition to a fairer system is itself fair to all. Our immediate scope is the UK, but our ideas could be applied anywhere. 

So let's get back to our story. Tax is not just a matter of theoretical interest but has also been a driver of history.  If Smith's book contributed to a revolution of ideas, in other parts of the world a more hot and imminent political revolution was brewing.

WHILST SMITH WORKED by candlelight, far across the oceans, in what was then the British colony of North America, some demonstrators were heaping tea into the sea. The demonstrators' objection: the British state was collecting taxation without giving them representation in the British parliament. Adam Smith himself agreed with the American revolutionaries that the North American colonies should be represented in the British parliament in proportion to the tax they paid. And from this dispute the American Revolution was born. 

Revolution was also imminent in France. A century earlier, Jean-Baptist Colbert, minister of Finance to the King of France, had said that 'The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of squawking.' By 1789, the geese had not only squawked, they had overthrown the farmer and taken control of the farm. The French Revolution had arrived. 

## Rural Land and Urban Location

In France, one of the first economists, Francois Quesnay, had argued for a single tax on the value of land to replace all other taxes. The tax never happened, indeed Adam Smith commented both on its economic benefit and its political challenges when he said, with dry irony 'The single tax on land is the tax that does not threaten to discourage industry anywhere'

Let's take our magic carpet to cross the Atlantic and forward a century in time. A journalist in San Francisco is learning his craft. He is fascinated by a subject which was then still called 'political economy'. And he was interested in one question in particular: why was there so much poverty in the midst of so much technological progress? George looked out at the world, and he noted that it was in the biggest, most advanced cities, with the most technological advancement, which also had the worst, most grinding, poverty. The journalist's name was Henry George and his book was called Progress and Poverty. 

George's work echoed the more turgid prose of banker and great economic theorist David Ricardo. Ricardo had argued that an agricultural landlord contributed nothing to the well being of society: he merely extracted the surplus from the land once the costs of labour and tools had been paid. This surplus is known as rent. As had been previously argued by Adam Smith, the best tax therefore was a tax on rent. Whilst Ricardo modelled a rural economy, Henry George was concerned also with urban land. The ownership of urban plots allowed the landowners to benefit as society developed. George popularised the message that the remedy was to tax urban landlords. He used beautiful words that everyday folk could understand. 

Inspired by Henry George, a woman by the name of Elizabeth Magie, invented a game called the Landlords' game. It illustrated that without a tax on urban land, property tended to get 'monopolized' and those who owned it extracted rent from those who did not.Change this If however the people who owned land were taxed on the value of that land, then a stable and fair (if rather boring) outcome ensued. Later the game was shorn of the beneficial, but boring, rules, leaving only the case where an unstable and unfair (if at times fun) ruleset remained. Therefore the original political implications of the game name were lost and the new game was marketed as 'Monopoly'. The goal of Monopoly is of course to own the whole board and to drive all the other players bankrupt. This might make an exciting game but it was far from a system of widely spread prosperity. The case for a land value tax is considered later in this book.

## War and Progress

Henry George inspired many of his readers, including the young Winston Churchill and British first world wartime prime minister Lloyd George. Towards the end of the first world war, there was even a budget which implemented a Land Value Tax, the 'People's Budget'. But due to the resistance of land owners and the difficulties of valuation, the budget was never implemented. Nevertheless, from the late 19th century through the whole of the twentieth century, and particularly after the second world war, the conditions of the poor improved. The curse of slum landlords and destitution was almost banished.

One great milestone in this history of progress was the Beveridge report. Released in 1942 and chaired by Liberal economist Lord Beveridge, it laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its aim was to banish the five great evils: 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. OrderAfter the war, Beveridge's report inspired an improved social security (benefits) system, public education, public housing, a national health service and macroeconomic management aimed at ensuring full employment. 

The reforms inspired by Beveridge and other social reformers helped to reduce the prevalence of these five great evils, and transformed the previously hellish conditions of the poor. But we have not achieved heaven on earth. There are great evils facing us: the destruction of the environment, the lack of affordable housing in many towns, great inequalities of wealth and the risks of automation. This book will explain why these evils arise and how they can be fixed.

## The Global Machine and the Global Mission

We are now in the present day. The subject then called political economy is now called economics.  Great container ships cross the oceans. Aircraft zig-zag the skies. Massive machines in far off lands churn out phones and other devices which everyone is looking at. Many people live lives with more consumer comforts than the past. But some things are very expensive: it is expensive to buy a flat in London for example; but it is relatively cheap to fly off to sun-kissed beaches on foreign shores.

This great machinery of commerce is devoted to two purposes: to give people what they desire (or at least what they can be encouraged to buy); and to make a profit in so doing. The commercial machine is in many ways smooth. But there are rumblings of discontent.  In 1848 the 'spectre of communism' overshadowed the world, according to Marx. Today the danger of environmental destruction, runaway technology and a state run by and for the superrich to enrich themselves still further, overshadows this machine for happy fulfilment of our consumer desires.

In America, a man promises to 'drain the swamp'. It would be natural to take these words to mean that the army of smart-suited lobbyists, that aim to direct the ship of state to favour their interests, would be sent packing. Nothing of the sort happened. Indeed the swamp got ever marshier. The poor, who had seen nothing much of forty years of economic growth in US were increasingly addicted to prescription painkillers. In the United Kingdom and the United States people stopped living longer.

This was by now a truly global civilisation. And scientists were warning that something truly global was wrong. In a conference room, a group of scientists called out for the radical shifts to stop burning fossil fuels in a couple of decades. The great machinery of commerce, which had since the end of the second world war been devoted to giving us more and more stuff, would need to be turned around to a new purpose.  

To turn around this great global machine, this supertanker of consumer commerce, we need to apply not only the great resources of the state, but also the dynamism and capacity of the private sector. We need to harness the profit motive for the good of the planet. And for that we need to tax the damages that individuals and companies cause to the living planet. In this book we seek to use the tax system to do so, not only by changing the incentives of the private sector in one country, but also by ensuring that other countries have a reason to follow that lead. 

Yes. The reforms that we are proposing will transform the prospects of the first to adopt them that others will have no choice but to follow that lead.

## The Prices of Flats and of Flights

It's now a wet November evening. Let me introduce Peter and his wife Lucy, who are shivering in their North London flat, pressing refresh on their email program and looking at their phones. They are waiting to see whether their offer on a two bedroom flat in a rundown neighbourhood of the city has been accepted or not.

An advert flicks up for a getaway flight to somewhere sunnier. If they can take the time off, then they can get away to a nice sunny island for a week. The small flat they are purchasing is, by any normal standards, inordinately expensive. They will be paying off their mortgage until they reach retirement age. And the flight to the sun is cheap, they can book it for less than one day's wages each.

To Peter and Lucy this is the usual way of things, although they don't like it much. Their friend Mel pointed out to them that the world is running out of time to tackle one of the major environmental problems facing it, climate change. Lucy feels a certain amount of guilt in the back of her mind for taking a holiday and the associated carbon emissions but is convinced by the low cost of the flights. When buying a roof over their heads is so expensive and so stressful, any normal person would need a little relief. They book the flight.

This book is about the prices of things, and how the prices of things is influenced by the taxation system. Houses and flights already have some taxes on them. If you live in a house, you pay Council Tax. And if you take a flight you pay Air Passenger Duty. Putting a higher tax on houses may actually reduce the purchase price of the house. That's because the value of the house depends in part on the obligations associated with it, taxation included. 

This book does not argue for environmental taxes primarily to change the behaviour of consumers. Rather it seeks to change the economy to provide goods in ways that do not damage the living planet. Sometimes this will be difficult. It's hard to design aeroplanes that do not burn oil products. But technological change adapts to market need. And if zero carbon planes cannot be designed, then perhaps those who fly should pay for the capture of Carbon Dioxide from the air elsewhere. In other words, the tax on flying, and other activities that produce warming greenhouse gases, should be enough to encourage people to capture those gases from the air if they cannot be eliminated directly.

The price of things in short needs to be just. And a just price of things requires a just tax system. And a just tax system will cause people to pay for the damage they cause to the environment. And a just system will also ensure that nobody gets rich merely by owning some of the limited things of life, such as land. In short, justice and benefit are the same, fairness and efficiency merely two sides of the same coin. That is Tax Heaven. And it is to such a tax system that this book is devoted.  

There's a corny old joke about the man that asks for directions and gets the response "Well if I was going there I wouldn't start from here". So it's not just the final state of affairs that must be just, but also the approach of getting from here to there. In the later parts of the book, we show how to transition in a fair way to a just tax system.
