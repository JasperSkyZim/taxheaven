# 1.1: Tax Heaven & Wealth of Nations

UNDER THE STARRY SKIES, far away from the everyday hustling and bustling of the commercial metropolis, sits a professor, beavering away at his manuscript. The year is 1773; the location Kirkaldy, a small town in Scotland; the author, Adam Smith. The full title of Smith's great work would be "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations".

On this cool and starry night, Smith was writing the fifth and final book of the "Wealth of Nations", entitled "On the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth". Smith asked: How should the activity of government be funded? Which taxes should a state impose? 

This book is devoted to similar questions: how should we fund the state? Which taxes should be levied and why? And related, what would make a better welfare system? We use taxation and welfare firstly as tools to preserve and enhance the wealth of the planet, of nations, of communities and of individuals. By wealth we mean the stock of valuable things, including the environment and individuals. And we are concerned also to distribute wealth fairly, partly by ensuring that wealth does not beget more wealth unless it is productively invested, and partly by ensuring that the transition to a fairer system is itself fair to all. Our immediate scope is the UK, but our ideas could be applied anywhere. 

So let's get back to our story. Tax is not just a matter of theoretical interest but has also been a driver of history.  Smith himself was agreed with the American revolutionaries that the colonies should be represented in the British parliament in proportion to the tax they paid. If Smith's book contributed to a revolution of ideas, in other parts of the world a more hot and imminent political revolution was brewing.

# 1.2: Tax Justice: Chariot of Revolutions and Sword of Ideals

WHILST SMITH WORKED by candlelight, far across the oceans, in what was then the British colony of North America, some demonstrators were heaping tea into the sea. The demonstrators' objection: the British state was collecting taxation without giving them representation in the British parliament. And so the American Revolution was born.

Revolution was also imminent in France. A century earlier, Jean-Baptist Colbert, minister of Finance to the King of France, had said that 'The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of squawking.' By 1789, the geese had not only squawked, they had overthrown the farmer and taken control of the farm. The French Revolution had arrived. 

## Rural Land and Urban Location

In France, one of the first economists, Francois Quesnay, had argued for a single tax on the value of land to replace all other taxes. The tax never happened, indeed Adam Smith commented both on its economic benefit and its political challenges when he said, with dry irony 'The single tax on land is the tax that does not threaten to discourage industry anywhere'

Let's take our magic carpet to cross the Atlantic and forward a century in time. A journalist in San Francisco is learning his craft. He is fascinated by a subject which was then still called 'political economy'. And he was interested in one question in particular: why was there so much poverty in the midst of so much technological progress? George looked out at the world, and he noted that it was in the biggest, most advanced cities, with the most technological advancement, which also had the worst, most grinding, poverty. The journalist's name was Henry George and his book was called Progress and Poverty. 

George's work echoed the more turgid prose of banker and great economic theorist David Ricardo. Ricardo had argued that an agricultural landlord contributed nothing to the well being of society: he merely extracted the surplus from the land once the costs of labour and tools had been paid. This surplus is known as rent. As had been previously argued by Adam Smith, the best tax therefore was a tax on rent. Whilst Ricardo modelled a rural economy, Henry George was concerned also with urban land. The ownership of urban plots allowed the landowners to benefit as society developed. George popularised the message that the remedy was to tax urban landlords. He used beautiful words that everyday folk could understand. 

Inspired by Henry George, a woman by the name of Elizabeth Magie, invented a game called the Landlords' game. It illustrated that without a tax on urban land, property tended to get 'monopolized' and those who owned it extracted rent from those who did not.Change this If however the people who owned land were taxed on the value of that land, then a stable and fair (if rather boring) outcome ensued. Later the game was shorn of the beneficial, but boring, rules, leaving only the case where an unstable and unfair (if at times fun) ruleset remained. Therefore the original political implications of the game name were lost and the new game was marketed as 'Monopoly'. The goal of Monopoly is of course to own the whole board and to drive all the other players bankrupt. This might make an exciting game but it was far from a system of widely spread prosperity. The case for a land value tax is considered later in this book.

## War and Progress

Henry George inspired many of his readers, including the young Winston Churchill and British first world wartime prime minister Lloyd George. Towards the end of the first world war, there was even a budget which implemented a Land Value Tax, the 'People's Budget'. But due to the resistance of land owners and the difficulties of valuation, the budget was never implemented. Nevertheless, from the late 19th century through the whole of the twentieth century, and particularly after the second world war, the conditions of the poor improved. The curse of slum landlords and destitution was almost banished.

One great milestone in this history of progress was the Beveridge report. Released in 1942 and chaired by Liberal economist Lord Beveridge, it laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its aim was to banish the five great evils: 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. OrderAfter the war, Beveridge's report inspired an improved social security (benefits) system, public education, public housing, a national health service and macroeconomic management aimed at ensuring full employment. 

The reforms inspired by Beveridge and other social reformers helped to reduce the prevalence of these five great evils, and transformed the previously hellish conditions of the poor. But we have not achieved heaven on earth. There are great evils facing us: the destruction of the environment, the lack of affordable housing in many towns, great inequalities of wealth and the risks of automation. This book will explain why these evils arise and how they can be fixed.

## The Global Machine and the Global Mission

We are now in the present day. The subject then called political economy is now called economics.  Great container ships cross the oceans. Aircraft zig-zag the skies. Massive machines in far off lands churn out phones and other devices which everyone is looking at. Many people live lives with more consumer comforts than the past. But some things are very expensive: it is expensive to buy a flat in London for example; but it is relatively cheap to fly off to sun-kissed beaches on foreign shores.

This great machinery of commerce is devoted to two purposes: to give people what they desire (or at least what they can be encouraged to buy); and to make a profit in so doing. The commercial machine is in many ways smooth. But there are rumblings of discontent.  In 1848 the 'spectre of communism' overshadowed the world, according to Marx. Today the danger of environmental destruction, runaway technology and a state run by and for the superrich to enrich themselves still further, overshadows this machine for happy fulfilment of our consumer desires.

In America, a man promises to 'drain the swamp'. It would be natural to take these words to mean that the army of smart-suited lobbyists, that aim to direct the ship of state to favour their interests, would be sent packing. Nothing of the sort happened. Indeed the swamp got ever marshier. The poor, who had seen nothing much of forty years of economic growth in US were increasingly addicted to prescription painkillers. In the United Kingdom and the United States people stopped living longer.

This was by now a truly global civilisation. And scientists were warning that something truly global was wrong. In a conference room, a group of scientists called out for the radical shifts to stop burning fossil fuels in a couple of decades. The great machinery of commerce, which had since the end of the second world war been devoted to giving us more and more stuff, would need to be turned around to a new purpose.  

To turn around this great global machine, this supertanker of consumer commerce, we need to apply not only the great resources of the state, but also the dynamism and capacity of the private sector. We need to harness the profit motive for the good of the planet. And for that we need to tax the damages that individuals and companies cause to the living planet. In this book we seek to use the tax system to do so, not only by changing the incentives of the private sector in one country, but also by ensuring that other countries have a reason to follow that lead. 

Yes. The reforms that we are proposing will transform the prospects of the first to adopt them that others will have no choice but to follow that lead.

## The Prices of Flats and of Flights

It's now a wet November evening. Let me introduce Peter and his wife Lucy, who are shivering in their North London flat, pressing refresh on their email program and looking at their phones. They are waiting to see whether their offer on a two bedroom flat in a rundown neighbourhood of the city has been accepted or not.

An advert flicks up for a getaway flight to somewhere sunnier. If they can take the time off, then they can get away to a nice sunny island for a week. The small flat they are purchasing is, by any normal standards, inordinately expensive. They will be paying off their mortgage until they reach retirement age. And the flight to the sun is cheap, they can book it for less than one day's wages each.

To Peter and Lucy this is the usual way of things, although they don't like it much. Their friend Mel pointed out to them that the world is running out of time to tackle one of the major environmental problems facing it, climate change. Lucy feels a certain amount of guilt in the back of her mind for taking a holiday and the associated carbon emissions but is convinced by the low cost of the flights. When buying a roof over their heads is so expensive and so stressful, any normal person would need a little relief. They book the flight.

This book is about the prices of things, and how the prices of things is influenced by the taxation system. Houses and flights already have some taxes on them. If you live in a house, you pay Council Tax. And if you take a flight you pay Air Passenger Duty. Putting a higher tax on houses may actually reduce the purchase price of the house. That's because the value of the house depends in part on the obligations associated with it, taxation included. 

This book does not argue for environmental taxes primarily to change the behaviour of consumers. Rather it seeks to change the economy to provide goods in ways that do not damage the living planet. Sometimes this will be difficult. It's hard to design aeroplanes that do not burn oil products. But technological change adapts to market need. And if zero carbon planes cannot be designed, then perhaps those who fly should pay for the capture of Carbon Dioxide from the air elsewhere. In other words, the tax on flying, and other activities that produce warming greenhouse gases, should be enough to encourage people to capture those gases from the air if they cannot be eliminated directly.

The price of things in short needs to be just. And a just price of things requires a just tax system. And a just tax system will cause people to pay for the damage they cause to the environment. And a just system will also ensure that nobody gets rich merely by owning some of the limited things of life, such as land. In short, justice and benefit are the same, fairness and efficiency merely two sides of the same coin. That is Tax Heaven. And it is to such a tax system that this book is devoted.  

There's a corny old joke about the man that asks for directions and gets the response "Well if I was going there I wouldn't start from here". So it's not just the final state of affairs that must be just, but also the approach of getting from here to there. In the later parts of the book, we show how to transition in a fair way to a just tax system.



# 1.3 Beveridge: Social Security and a Social Contract

Further down the street from Peter and Lucy lives Fred. Fred is on benefits. He once took a job, but he found that once this happened his benefits were cut off. There was a gap between his new wage and the benefits coming in. Thanks to this he didn't have the money for the rent. The UK has rolled out a reform known as 'Universal Credit', which integrates four income-related benefits into one. The 'benefits withdrawal' rate (in effect the income tax on additional income) on Universal Credit is 'only' 63%, which means that you only lose two thirds of the extra income you got.

It does not have to be this way. One great milestone in the history of progress in the UK was the Beveridge report.  Seventy-five years ago liberal economist William Beveridge presented his report concerning a new welfare state in the UK to parliament. Commissioned in 1942 and chaired by liberal economist Lord Beveridge, it laid the basis for the post war welfare state to banish 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. It[-@Beveridge1942], laid the basis of the British postwar welfare state.Crucially, he argued for universal benefits, as of right, rasther than the system of means testing that has since developed. His report was guided by the following three principles [@Beveridge1942: Part 1, paragraphs 6-9].

First, he argued that World War II and its aftermath was 'a time for revolutions not patching'. He offered a radical approach, informed by the experience of the past, without being restricted by the interests of one group or another. In short, his report would be *radical* (working from first principles) and prioritise the common interest.

Second, he argued for a *comprehensive* solution to the five 'giant' social problems of the poor. His report dealt primarily with want (poverty) and disease (poor health). The other three 'giants' were ignorance (lack of education), squalor (poor housing), and idleness (unemployment). Accordingly his report laid the basis not only for the UK's postwar welfare (or social security) system, but also the National Health Service, public education, housing policy, and a system of macroeconomic management aiming for full employment. 

Finally, Beveridge argued that there should be reward for contribution and service. The social contract of the mixed economy involves *cooperation* between the State and the individual. The welfare system should not stifle incentive, opportunity or responsibility. It would be an insurance system, i.e. a system of *giving* in return for *subsistence* benefits as a universal *right* and *without* means-testing. The state would offer the security of a subsistence standard of living in exchange for *service* and *contribution*. Welfare benefits would not preclude individuals from employment or self-employment, and benefits would not be withdrawn as people earned more. The outcome of this in reality has been very different to what Beveridge intended.

In short, we could say that the Beveridge principles are as follows:

- *Radical*: From first principles, without fear or favour to social class or other interest groups.
- *Comprehensive*: Dealing with poverty, disease, bad housing, unemployment and a lack of education.
- *A liberal social contract*: No means-testing and so no stifling of incentives, but also cooperation between the state and individuals/firms.

World War II had almost bankrupted Britain. Britain had initially financed the war through borrowing both domestically and internationally, especially from the United States. However, despite a public debt ratio which peaked at 238% of GDP in 1947, and the gradual loss of its prewar Empire, postwar Britain soon rebuilt itself and managed to provide for its people a standard of living greater than that before the war. Pursuing a policy of low interest rates, moderate inflation and high growth, the burden of debt was cut to 70% of GDP in 30 years. These accomplishments are in themselves remarkable, and we will touch on how they were achieved later on in this book.

Beveridge was largely successful in his mission to lay the foundation for a comprehensive welfare state. However, some of his principles, especially the third, were unevenly applied. 

**Principle 1: A Fundamental Review**

The premise of this book is to look at tax and welfare from first principles, and then to apply those first principles without fear and favour.

But are we at a revolutionary time? Can we change a complex system like tax and welfare from first principles, or is 'patching' the only realistic possibility? We will assert that change is possible only if it is beneficial, fair and smooth, and communicated well so that these aspects are evident.

One does not make fundamental progress without thinking fundamentally about what a system should do and what it should be. We also need to consider the motivation for, and the barriers to change. One barrier is undoubtedly the worry that some people will be made worse off by any changes. Therefore, we need to ensure not only that the final state is fair, but also fairness is upheld the transition between the current system and the new is also fair.

**Principle 2: The New Five Great Challenges**

We still have Beveridge's giant social issues to some degree, but we are also faced with new problems. This book, like Beveridge's report, is devoted to five great societal challenges which face us now:

- *Wealth*: Inequality of income and wealth, and especially that caused by arguably unfair means; tax avoidance and evasion; dominance of large mega-corporations with market power enriching the rich and wielding political power. Dealing with the challenge of increasing automation of work so that everyone has an adequate income and plenty of free time.
- *High Rent on Land and Resources*: Unaffordability of renting or purchasing homes, and the cost of importing fossil fuels.
- *Pollution and other environmental damage*: Climate change, ocean acidification, plastics, overfishing and habitat loss which all threaten the future.
- *Debt and Economic imbalance*: Rebalancing the economy away from borrowing and asset inflation, and towards balanced growth and wealth formation.
- *Tax Evasion and Avoidance*: Can a tax system be designed that is simple and yet difficult to avoid?

**Principle 3: A Social Contract Aligning Reward and Contribution**

Our new welfare system should not disincentivise work and should encourage service and contribution. We will study in detail Beveridge's third principle to see if, and how, a better welfare system can be created. 

This involves the *integration* of the tax system with the benefits system so there is not a separate system of 'means testing': this function can be carried out through the tax system. This suggests the case for a system with a universal component: we call this a 'citizen's dividend' (a form of basic income). Furthermore, we argue for an integrated skills training and work experience system. These two proposals are outlined in part 11.

**From 'Universal Credit' to truly Universal Benefits**

Many voices have called not for Universal Credit but instead a basic income. The big difference with a basic income is that the benefits are paid whether you work or not. But is a Basic Income politically feasible. A 'simplifying' basic income scheme would increase income tax, including eliminating personal allowances, in order to pay for it. But is a basic income politically feasible? Most well functioning benefits systems do take benefits away from them if they do not work or pay taxes. But instead of the current system of conditionality we argue here for a system that degrades very slightly over time if the person does not pay taxes or do any other sort of worthwhile activity. Over time, this would transform into a sovereign wealth fund basic income, with individuals building up assets to fund the welfare payments.

# 1.4: Heavenly Economics

TAXATION CAN NOT ONLY be a chariot of revolutions and a sword of economic ideals. Taxes can also benefit us in the here and now. Whilst Smith's fourth maxim argues for taxes that have low costs of collection which do not negatively affect the economy, our aim here is subtly different. We wish not just to minimise the costs of taxation, but rather to aim for taxes, where possible, that are actively beneficial. Good taxes would shape the profit motive towards the needs of people, communities, and the living planet on which we all depend. Here we seek a tax and social security system that is not only fair and practical, but also beneficial to everyday people, our country and our world. 

But what good are we aiming at? In this section we imagine an ideal island society, and then consider five ways that the taxation system can contribute to this heavenly state.

Let's picture an island of our dreams. The fruit is bountiful, the water is clean, the people are happy. Everyone has a house or can build one with their own money. Fisheries and forests are managed well. Some people are richer than others, but the difference isn't huge, and the people are rich or high status are those that have contributed the most to society. The community collaborates to ensure that the political system is not corrupt and governs the society well, the citizens trade with other islands and each other. There is work for all, but no-one has to work very long hours. The financial system supports beneficial activities, for example clean power and a recharging system for electric cars. Financially, people are secure with investments in the local factory, which, whilst its mostly robotised, provides everyone with a dividend to spend on the products that it and other factories produce.

image-1 # Lofoten Islands, Norway

What has this fantasy island got to do with our life here and now, and in particular our taxation system? Tax, we claim, can encourage the private sector towards this heavenly state. And it is not only tax and the social security system which we propose to reform, but also some elements of the financial, education and pensions systems. We do not however consider these systems in full: that we must leave to others to consider.

Now what can we say about tax on this island? Well, in simple terms, tax is fair and fairly simple and straightforward for everyone to understand. But the tax system in important ways, supports the rest of the economy, not only in how the revenue can be spent but also in the ways that the tax system creates the incentives for the economy to function correctly. The two main ways that the taxation system can be used are generally *redistributive* and *environmental taxes*. 

## Historical Case Studies

Our argument would be more concrete if we could point to situations around the world where this might happen.

**Progressive Income and Corporation Tax: USA in the period 1945-1980**

The United States in the post war showed the advantage of redistributive income taxation, including high tax rates on companies. The top rate of income tax was often over 70% in that period, and taxes on companies were also higher than at present. Because everyone's incomes were not widely different, this meant that normal people could not only afford consumer goods, but also everyone had a chance to buy the limited positional goods such as land. Since the top rate of tax was high, and since income tax is the largest and most important tax, this meant that the average tax rate paid by people on average earnings was lower. We discuss this is parts 6 and 7.

**Land Value Capture: Singapore and Hong Kong since independence**

Singapore shows what has been termed the 'property state' [@Haila2015]: it shows what is possible when there is a 'prosperity loop' between investment in public infrastructure and public rent collection. In short, as the government makes infrastructure improvements, those increase the rental value of the land, and those land value increases then accrue to the government. Hong Kong also shows the advantages of this approach: before a new metro line is built, land near the new stations is purchased at pre-announcement cost and so society captures the land value benefit of the new infrastructure [Purves. We discuss this is part 8.

**Environmental Taxes: Scandanavia, Switzerland and the UK **

Three European countries show that a carbon tax can work exactly as planned. Sweden, Switzerland and the UK all have a carbon tax. Sweden was one of the first to introduce its carbon tax and the per capita CO_2_ emissions of Sweden are now amongst the lowest in Europe. Similarly Switzerland has also introduced such a tax. The UK introduced its carbon price floor more recently, and it has seen a large fall in emissions. Most notably we have seen a drop in the use of coal in electricity generation. Other environmental taxes include charges for plastic bags. 

**Financial 'Repression': UK in the period 1945-1980**

One great anxiety is about *debt*. There are basically two forms of debt that concern people: public (or government) debt and private debt. High public debt pressures governments to 'cut the deficit' through 'austerity'. Yet in the past, the best way to reduce the burden of public debt has been not to worry about it: or rather to use different strategies. In the three decades after the second world war, the UK reduced its public debt to GDP ratio from over 250% of GDP to 70% of GDP. It did this not through austerity, but rather through growth, inflation, monetisation of some debt, and low interest rates. We consider the fiscal benefits of such strategies later in this book.**

# 1.5: A Tripartite Framework for Taxes

What are taxes really for? What makes a good tax system? Is there such a thing? These questions remain unexplored for many people for whom taxes are just an inevitability, a necessary evil, and a yearly burden. As the old saying goes - there is nothing so certain in life as death and taxes.

There are those, of course, for whom the very concept of tax raises strong passions. Staunch libertarians claim that taxation is the blatant theft of private property, while social democrats often consider taxation to be a moral matter in the redressing of the unfairness of the free market. Emotions can therefore run high in debates on the purposes of taxation, and there often appears to be little common ground. This can make discussions of the philosophical basis of taxation somewhat difficult. But it is into this fraught debate that we are attempting to venture, with a hope to outline principles on which all (or most) will agree.

So if we assume, for now, that taxes are a necessary evil, then we must establish some guiding principles on how they should be applied. As our starting point, we have chosen three core characteristics which we suggest that all and every tax should possess. Taxes should be *beneficial*, *practical* and *fair*.

## Beneficial (Not Harmful)

To be beneficial is to do good overall. There are multiple ways in which different taxes might be said to 'do good', and people may fairly disagree on what 'good' means. However all taxes must have some legitimate claim to be beneficial. Most would agree that a tax is beneficial if it pays for valued public services. For example, taxation that pays for our National Health Service, our emergency services, our roads, schools and public transport, is generally considered necessary and beneficial. This is evidenced by a recent survey of British citizens [@PWC2017] which found that the majority would be willing to pay more tax if it lead to improvements in the quality of the NHS. 

More contentiously, taxation may be said to be doing good by redistributing income (or at least ensuring that the rich contribute more), helping to alleviate poverty, and reducing large wealth disparities. Tax may be used to ensure a minimum standard of living by providing an income 'safety net'. 

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behavior by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage our natural environment, and health, by polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. So by taxing harm, it encourage companies to include these costs in their decision making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or investing to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such land. Of course, if tax is not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Instead the private sector, specifically, the existing owners will ration the resources through increasingly higher prices (rents), and in so doing provide unearned value or income to those who control them. Taxation can be used to fairly ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced, so that the country benefits as a whole.

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behavior by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage the natural environment and health of all citizens by polluting the atmosphere on which we all depend. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. So by taxing harm, it encourage companies to include these costs in their decision-making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or by creating pools of investment to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such as land. Of course, if taxes are not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Lacking this, the private sector, specifically the existing ownersship class, will ration these resources through increasingly higher rents, and as the rents go up, so will the sale price. In this way unearned income and capital gains will accrue to those who control the scarce resources. Taxation can be used to fairly ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced, so that the country benefits as a whole.



## Fair (Just)

There are three ways in which we think taxes must be fair: consistency, progressivity, and justice in transition. 

The first is that they must be fair in the sense of being consistent. Identical persons, companies and situations should be treated identically. There should be no special exemptions or 'sweetheart deals' for favoured individuals or companies. As we shall see in the section on corporation tax, this principle can be flouted by particularly big or powerful companies.

Related to this idea of fairness are concepts of accountability and transparency. Taxes must not just be fair, but must be seen to be fair. Thus taxes should be clear and transparent, such that it is apparent to everyone what the proper tax burden should be for each income bracket. These issues are particularly topical in Britain today. In early 2017, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee expressed concern that HMRC's 'lack of transparency' concerning high net worth individuals 'has eroded public trust in a fair tax system' [@HoC2017].

Another, perhaps more controversial, kind of fairness concerns *progressivity*. A progressive tax is a tax in which those who have more, pay more. UK income tax is thus a progressive tax as richer citizens pay more proportionally than poorer citizens. We think that this is fair and thus we believe that taxes should be fair in the sense of being progressive. However, this viewpoint is not without controversy.

Fairness is also relevant to our discussion of economic rents and land values. When land values increase because of work performed by society as a whole by our definition it would be fair if all citizens benefit. It would seem unfair for only some people to benefit. Similarly, it would seem unfair if only a few people benefited from the country's natural resources - resources which were not created by any person, but which form part of the wealth of the nation as a whole. 

Finally, fairness is necessary in the transition from the existing system to the new system. This is necessary not only for reasons of justice, but also the political feasibility of the reforms: if they are seen as unfair to people here and now, they would be unpopular.

## Practical (Functions Smoothly)

If a tax was fair and intended to do good, but couldn't be implemented without requiring masses of paperwork, or prohibitive costs, or extreme social controls, then no matter the benefit, it would not be justifiable. Taxes must be practical to implement. There are many aspects to practicality and we cover them here. When considering whether a tax is practical, we might consider how close it is to a theoretical ideal. 

Ideally, a tax should be simple to implement and administer. It also should have low collection and compliance costs. This means that it should not cost the government huge sums to collect, and it should also be very easy for taxpayers to comply with. The less paperwork, time-consuming research and confusing the rules involved, the better. Taxes which are automatically collected are more practical in this regard than those which require large amounts of form-filling and record-keeping. 

Another aspect of practicality is predictability. Individuals and companies must be able to predict future expenses in order to arrange financial matters. 

In a similar vein, taxes must be clearly defined so that taxpayers can plan their affairs while knowing exactly how much tax they can expect to pay. One example which has been a particularly hot topic in recent years concerns tax evasion. Tax avoidance is the *legal* dodging of tax; tax evasion is the *illegal* dodging of tax. It is clear that a tax which is easily evadable or avoidable will not be practical because it will not function to increase public funds, and may require significant resources to be wasted chasing up non-complying 'tax cheats'. 

# 1.6: Four Crucial Benefits of Good Taxes

There are four crucial benefits of a better taxation system to wider society:

1) *A clean and safe global environment:* The first priority is the environment. Starting with the most important part of the tax system, the system of environmental taxation. There are a number of major environmental problems facing us, most notably climate change and ocean acidification, but also including the prevalence of plastics in the ocean, habitat destruction, road congestion, overfishing, rare resource consumption and conventional air, water and land pollution. Using environmental taxes faces a few challenges: they can be unpopular, hard to design, encourage 'offshoring' of dirty forms of manufacture and bureaucratic. Finally, because sometimes demand for damaging products can be unresponsive to price, a high environmental tax may be necessary, but high environmental taxes may be unpopular, disruptive or unrealistic. Also, individual country actions are not enough. Instead we need action that is global. But there are not functioning global institutions. Thus, we look for solutions that can be implemented at a national level, which *and* which encourage other countries to follow the lead. Such solutions should be within international laws as rules as well. We show how those potential issues can be overcome.

Because it is so important, we do not intend to raise additional revenue with this taxation source, but we do intend to ensure that the private sector has the correct incentives. To accomplish that we start with a higher carbon tax on electricity production. Electricity production should have an incentive to be carbon neutral. We achieve this with a tax on carbon inputs with a subsidy on electricity production.  Simultaneously we also provide low cost loans from the public loan board. There will be prizes for rapid rollout of new technologies and national targets for the roll out of low-carbon electricity. We have a CARBON TAX.

2) *A prosperous and wealthy country:* The second priority is a prosperous and wealthy country. The current taxation system does not encourage productive wealth formation. In fact it encourages those sorts of companies that *extract* wealth from the country and discourages those who wish to invest in the society. A better system would encourage people who invest in *real assets*, but discourage purely financial investment/ In short, a good tax system encourages a balance of trade. It discourages foreign investment in a financial sense whilst encouraging investment in a real sense. An optimal taxation system would involve a collaboration between state and the private sector, so the gains of research and development investment are shared between both. And an optimal social security system would involve some funding from sovereign wealth funds, including personal accounts, so that the people and state accumulate assets to support them in hard times.

For this we need to provide an incentive for companies like Dyson to locate into the UK. We suggest the following: a *higher* corporate tax but calculated as follows: Sales - UK Wages - UK Investment. In other words, the tax should *encourage* uk companies to invest in the UK. We call this a DYSON TAX.The financial system should be encouraged to lend to real businesses.

3) *An affordable home in a prosperous community*. The third priority is an affordable home for all. British governments have massively mismanaged the taxation of housing and business properties. By appropriately taxing the value of the location (land), in a way that is convenient and fair for all, we make it possible for most people to have the economic benefits of owning their own home. An optimal tax system would encourage community action, so that 'community entrepreneurship' allows communities to develop their value and capture the fruits of this development. How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England?  How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England? 

Well the first thing is to capture location rent increases for public causes. What does this mean? That means that the property taxes: council taxes, business rates and stamp duty should be rolled up into a single tax. This should be a tax on property with the *value* of tangible investment deductible. So that means that a house is a value, so you shouldn't be charged on this. The residual should be allocated between the local community, the municipal authority and the central government. Taxing property values rather than property per se would stabilise the current property values. We have a LAND VALUE TAX payable in cash or deferred until sale or death.

4) *Secure incomes, productive jobs and economic power:* The current social security system is highly insecure: benefits are taken away from people when their conditions change, leading them often to go into arrears with their rent or other payments, and often leading them into debt. The current social security system also discourages work, as benefits are withdrawn as income increases (in the Universal Credit system at a rate of 61% for every £ increase in income). A better benefit would not be withdrawn so rapidly as income increases, would encourage people to increase their skill level, would be well integrated with the taxation system and would also support those who enhance their communities in ways other than simply earning money (for example by caring or raising a child). It would also allow division of labour with minimal taxation between individuals in communities (so eliminating the tax advantages of being a company relative to an everyday citizen).

The fourth priority is secure incomes, productive jobs and economic power. For this, we need to simplify the existing income and means-tested benefit system. Rather than the current system of means testing benefits, there would be a single system of basic income and taxation. A 'simplifying' basic income payable to everyone in society would be combined with a simplification of the system of income taxation, so that a standard rate of 40% is applied to all income up to the point when someone reaches the top 1% of incomes. Furthermore there would be citizen wealth funds, and assets would be granted to individuals based on how much tax they paid. There would be a 'target minimum level' of wealth and individual's tax would build up this minimum level of wealth. We have a SIMPLIFIED INCOME TAX, BASIC INCOME and WEALTH FUND.

# 1.7: How Does Change Happen? Transition & Political Feasibility

How do we change a system like tax? This book deals with tax reform in two approaches. The first is a 'blank slate' approach. This considers how we would define a tax and welfare system in an ideal world where both efficiency and fairness are achieved easily. 

The second approach takes into account issues of improvement and transition. In other words, what practical politically feasible changes could be made right now to make the system more beneficial and fair?

So what does practicality look like? Often in policy, it is synonymous with political feasibility. Previously, we mentioned the idea of political realism and transitional justice. Changes must not seem both unfair and have obvious losers. Fairness will be often perceived to be a matter of *transition* as opposed to the sort of a perspective we might have when trying to create a tax system from a 'blank state' (as we do within this book). 

The tax system seems to change through top down directives, through the intervention of the chancellor of the exchequer of the time. This approach means that the tax system often changes with the agenda of 'budget day' announcements. Of course,the secrecy around these announcements is to a degree necessary: if agents know how the tax system is going to change, then they may be able to take steps to avoid the taxes. A better approach would be to conduct a strategic tax review, much in a similar way to the strategic defence review.

Any discussion of taxation and welfare needs to consider *political realism*. What is political realism? It's recognising that some policies are politically easier to implement than others. In the context of taxation and welfare, we need to consider *transitional justice* and in particular not make any major groups worse off (except those that had previously benefitted unfairly). So, for example, it might be argued that a 100% land value tax is appropriate in certain locations, but to impose such a tax immediately would be unfair on those people who had recently purchased a house in the last year in a high land value area.

So what would it take to make change happen? I argue here that we need:

1. Political desire for change, a broad public consensus that there is a wrong that needs to be righted.
2. A shared narrative understanding of the principles on which any new plan might be based
3. Proposals that people could rally around
4. Communication of this plan 
5. An opportunity
6. People ready to take advantage of this opportunity when it does arise.

How do we create that narrative? Well, this book is a contribution to it. It is very important to build a narrative that works for everyone in society and caters to the different ways that people live in the world and contribute to their economic lives.

The first principle of the Beveridge report was that 'revolutionary times need revolutions not patching'. We do not at present have the luxury of a fresh start. But we are starting to live in revolutionary times. Tax and welfare justice and simplification and their benefits in tackling great challenges facing us are, we suggest, good places to start. This book aims to provide some policies to help escape from a possible hell of environmental destruction and inequality. It gives us the means to complete Smith's goal of widely shared prosperity in a beautiful and secure planetary home. And it shows that our responsibility to our nation and our planet is not only personal but also political. We seek a Tax Heaven to preserve what we have, and to ensure a more heavenly future. Our quest is to search for tax heaven, that is a tax and social security system that is beneficial, practical and fair.  In order to achieve that, In order to predict the effects of the tax system, we will need to expostulate a theory of how the economy works. We will need to define in turn the benefits as well as the costs that could come from a tax system. We will need to work the a system that is practical, and just.  In order to actually change the tax system, we will need to develop a theory of how political change might happen. Finally we will need to work out how realistically how we can get from where we are today to where we wish to be.**

We must reclaim our minds and awaken to the story we have been told about how the economy works. We must see the evidence of the consequences, and realise that there are alternatives. We must start to tell a new story. 

## Previous Frameworks and Guidelines for Successful Reform

According to Bird and Oldman [-@BirdAndOldman] there are eleven main aspects that need to be considered for a successful tax reform. In this section we take Bird and Oldman's categories, and specify them for this particular book, in the order that they are covered in this book:     
1. *Taxation theory*: Taxing rent and externalities, taking account of the theory of optimal taxation (both its classical formulation and the recent additions).   
2. Macroeconomic situation*: Balance of payments, trade deficit.   
3. *Attractiveness of proposals to politicians and voters*: A reform should be attractive to voters and to specific politician types. There should also be feasible policy pathways to achieving the reform. 
4. *Political realities*: Interest of voter groups, popular notions justice, Interest of powerful groups.
5. *Institutional inertia*: Capture proposals for overcoming this.     
6. *Administrative realities*: Including the existing tax system, making taxes easily calculable, and making the system as automatic as possible.     
7. *Empirical evidence*, for example: effect of incentives at work; Interaction between work, experience, education and salary; effect of environmental taxes on damage; effect of health taxes on health outcomes; effect of taxes on finance.   
8. *Robustness to changing times*: We look at the changing nature of work, and consider the dynamic effects of our tax proposals. 
9. Local knowledge*: Legal nature of tax system; specific problems of UK system tax and economy (regional balances, dysfunctional house prices etc.).      
10. Produce beneficial results: See modelling chapter.

**Feasibility of proposals**
Malcolm Torry in his recent book 'The feasibility of citizen's income' [@Torry2016], considers desirability of an unconditional per capita payment to all citizens and then distinguishes between, and analyses, seven different types of 'feasibility':
1. Fiscal
2. Household financial
3. Psychological
4. Administrative
5. Behavioural
6. Political
7. Policy process
We cover these notions of feasibility in our evaluation of these proposals in part 14.

# 1.8 Summary of the Rest of the Book

We want to produce a *radical, comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

*Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing Ualany tax or system of taxation. Each covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions.

Part I of this book (which you have just read) defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, good and practical tax system. What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, good and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately. 

Part II considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasizing where our ideas are new or innovative. We consider the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes  natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment.  


Part III builds a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the major important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out 10 key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. We ask the hypothetical question: *how would the world be different if this or that assumption were true*. We then use quantitative data to see which assumption is appropriate.

Part IV builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to fairly transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Part V, the longest in the book, considers the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality seems to be driven not only by difference in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation.  Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sector, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them. We then apply these ideas to the sectors of the economy.

Part VI, contains our proposals and the quantitative modelling work on them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented.  We outline our proposals model them and conclude the book in part 14. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.
