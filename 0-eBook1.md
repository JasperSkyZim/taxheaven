- Situation: We have a market economy with competition, growth and technological progress.
- Complication: But we have poverty and pollution
- Question: How do we fix these issues of poverty and pollution?
- Answer: Carbon Tax and LVT but tailored for a change management political evolutionary landscape

The core theses of this book are:

1. The cause of environmental destruction is failure of regulation, specifically the lack of appropriate pricing of environmental damage
2. The cause of inequality is non-degrading private property in limited things such as land and corporations with market power.
3. The cause of failure to implement appropriate policy is a lack of an appropriate theory of change.

In more detail:

1. Wicked Externalities
   1. There are externalities and they are significant (descriptive point)
   2. If there are external effects they should be accounted for in the tax system (theoretical point)
   3. Carbon Tax will have desired effect (functional point)
   4. if we make those tax changes we should have a certain response (responsive point)
2. Monopoly and Poverty
   1. There are non-productive (monopoly) assets (descriptive point)
   2. If there are monopoly assets, then it's efficient and equitable to tax them (theoretical point)
   3. LVT, cashflow-deductible-investment and corporate wealth tax will have desired effect (functional point)
   4. If we tax them, then their price will fall; also wealth will be transferred to productive activities increasing human wealth (responsive point).
3. Theory of Change
   1. Change happens when desire overcomes resistance
   2. Resistance is associated with perceived concentrated financial losses
   3. Instead minimise losses whilst maximising the effect and associate that with moral statements of real intent (e.g. 'everyone deserves an affordable home', 'every child deserves a nice planet', 'provide opportunities to mobilise the private sector and people to make the changes we need')

# 1. PREFACE

This book is addressed to those who are looking for a new economic model for rich and poor countries across the world. The intended audience includes economists, scientists, politicians, businesspeople, other professionals and interested members of the general public.

it is concerned with how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent',  international flows of money and assets. Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without governance systems to constrain them. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies, leading to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich. International tax  avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep. 

The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems. The book proposes a simple and effective tax and social security system to solve these problems and to enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet.

We are interested in two other systems in particular that overlap with the tax system: the financial and monetary system, the social security (also known as welfare or 'benefits') system including skills training. The examples given relate to the reform of the UK tax and welfare system, but the ideas herein are intended to be applicable to most societies around the world. Out of scope is the detail of the benefits system and the detailed technicalities of how some taxes  work at the moment. We keep it to the broad scale big picture more than the accounting of taxes, although we do cover some implementation choices.

## Economics, Opportunity And Hope

This is a story of opportunity and hope. This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich are poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore it is a book about economics. That is not to say that the government can't do good and important things. But if the private sector is not to do bad things for our general well being then the right tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system taxes bad things not good things, and taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The main point is that physical use of natural resources should be taxed; and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes  natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with the benefits and training system, the finance system, the energy system and the housing system. In short our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having new purpose to grow opportunity in our society. We do this through a transformation of the incentives.

## Historical Case Studies

We wish not just to minimise the costs of taxation, but rather to aim for taxes, where possible, that are actively beneficial. Good taxes would shape the profit motive towards the needs of people, communities, and the living planet on which we all depend. Here we seek a tax and social security system that is not only fair and practical, but also beneficial to everyday people, our country and our world. Our argument would be more concrete if we could point to situations around the world where this might happen.

**Welfare and Work -- Beveridge and the UK in the late 1940s**

As we discuss in chapter 3, the Beveridge report shows a possible way forward for welfare. Before the second world war, the five social evils of Want, Squalor, Idleness, Disease and Ignorance ravaged the poor in Britain. the second world war destroyed many buildings, homes and businesses alike, and increased the government and external debt. But yet the post war government managed to create a comprehensive welfare state where none existed before: a health service, It also managed its debt.

**Finance: Financial 'Repression' in the UK in the period 1945-1980**

One great anxiety is about *debt*. There are basically two forms of debt that concern people: public (or government) debt and private debt. High public debt pressures governments to 'cut the deficit' through 'austerity'. Yet in the past, the best way to reduce the burden of public debt has been not to worry about it: or rather to use different strategies. In the three decades after the second world war, the UK reduced its public debt to GDP ratio from over 250% of GDP to 70% of GDP. It did this not through austerity, but rather through growth, inflation, monetisation of some debt, and low interest rates. We consider the fiscal benefits of such strategies later in this book.

**Income and Corporation Tax: USA in the period 1945-1980**

The United States in the post war showed the advantage of redistributive income taxation, including high tax rates on companies. The top rate of income tax was often over 70% in that period, and taxes on companies were also higher than at present. Because everyone's incomes were not widely different, this meant that normal people could not only afford consumer goods, but also everyone had a chance to buy the limited positional goods such as land. Since the top rate of tax was high, and since income tax is the largest and most important tax, this meant that the average tax rate paid by people on average earnings was lower. We discuss this is parts 6 and 7.

**Land Value Capture: Singapore and Hong Kong since independence**

Singapore shows what has been termed the 'property state' [@Haila2015]: it shows what is possible when there is a 'prosperity loop' between investment in public infrastructure and public rent collection. In short, as the government makes infrastructure improvements, those increase the rental value of the land, and those land value increases then accrue to the government. Hong Kong also shows the advantages of this approach: before a new metro line is built, land near the new stations is purchased at pre-announcement cost and so society captures the land value benefit of the new infrastructure [Purves. We discuss this is part 8.

**Environmental Taxes: Scandinavia, Switzerland and the UK **

Three European countries show that a carbon tax can work exactly as planned. Sweden, Switzerland and the UK all have a carbon tax. Sweden was one of the first to introduce its carbon tax and the per capita $CO_2$ emissions of Sweden are now amongst the lowest in Europe. Similarly Switzerland has also introduced such a tax. The UK introduced its carbon price floor more recently, and it has seen a large fall in emissions. Most notably we have seen a drop in the use of coal in electricity generation. Other environmental taxes include charges for plastic bags. 

## A Theory of Change

The way that we need to set up this tax system needs to maximize the effect whilst minimizing the resistance. It's this sort of system that can maximize the good that can be achieved. In two areas in particular: in environmental/energy policy and in housing policy. If you want to have a big effect you need a big incentive, but big incentives cause big losers and therefore political resistance. In other words we use financial incentives to promote wider forms of entrepreneurship for public benefit.

We suggest four forms of entrepreneurship. Firstly public good entrepreneurship: we suggest that the private sector be turned over to public good provision. the obvious example is green entrepreneurship, but we also suggest ways that companies can tackle other global issues such as the lack of good antibiotics. The second issue is state capitalism entrepreneurship. This involves both the state and capitalists. The third is municipal land value entrepreneurship, as has been seen in Singapore and Hong Kong. The fourth is skill based personal and social entrepreneurship. There's a fifth overarching concept too, which we term policy entrepreneurship. That is, we should break out of the monopoly of thought imposed on us by neoclassical economics and neoliberal economic ideas. These forms of entrepreneurship imply a new growth model for everyone, one that is not based on increasing financialization and debt issued on limited assets but rather the development of productive industries solving our collective problems

What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, good and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately. 

## Proposals

We will set out how, on a consumption basis, \*taxing\* the environmental damage that people cause is sensible, that we should tax unproductive and unearned wealth, and finally we should tax luxury consumption using the income tax system to ensure it is progressive.

We also have some reforms for the benefits and training system. We suggest a dividend for everyone, a cheque in the post -- and to integrate the tax and benefits system, replacing means testing with taxation (since it achieves the same thing, taking money away from people as they earn more). We also suggest an active benefits system for training people up in high skills. We suggest the accumulation of wealth across the poor, rather than the government having the responsibility to support them. Then, when people pay their tax, some of that tax would be set aside as a contribution that will fund the purchase of assets, a return to a contributory tax system.

Finally we suggest changes to the financial system. Allied to our tax on wealth is a tax on lending on unproductive wealth. Thus we encourage investment across the economy. We use the financial system to actively promote the capture of land rent for public purposes. We suggest particularly low cost loans for the building a new cost infrastructure, in this country and around the world. Finance is particularly international and lending can ensure that everyone gets enough energy.

## Four Crucial Benefits of Good Taxes

There are four crucial benefits of a better taxation system to wider society:

1) *A clean and safe global environment:* The first priority is the environment. Starting with the most important part of the tax system, the system of environmental taxation. There are a number of major environmental problems facing us, most notably climate change and ocean acidification, but also including the prevalence of plastics in the ocean, habitat destruction, road congestion, overfishing, rare resource consumption and conventional air, water and land pollution. Using environmental taxes faces a few challenges: they can be unpopular, hard to design, encourage 'offshoring' of dirty forms of manufacture and bureaucratic. Finally, because sometimes demand for damaging products can be unresponsive to price, a high environmental tax may be necessary, but high environmental taxes may be unpopular, disruptive or unrealistic. Also, individual country actions are not enough. Instead we need action that is global. But there are not functioning global institutions. Thus, we look for solutions that can be implemented at a national level, which *and* which encourage other countries to follow the lead. Such solutions should be within international laws as rules as well. We show how those potential issues can be overcome.

Because it is so important, we do not intend to raise additional revenue with this taxation source, but we do intend to ensure that the private sector has the correct incentives. To accomplish that we start with a higher carbon tax on electricity production. Electricity production should have an incentive to be carbon neutral. We achieve this with a tax on carbon inputs with a subsidy on electricity production.  Simultaneously we also provide low cost loans from the public loan board. There will be prizes for rapid rollout of new technologies and national targets for the roll out of low-carbon electricity. We have a CARBON TAX.

2) *A prosperous and wealthy country:* The second priority is a prosperous and wealthy country. The current taxation system does not encourage productive wealth formation. In fact it encourages those sorts of companies that *extract* wealth from the country and discourages those who wish to invest in the society. A better system would encourage people who invest in *real assets*, but discourage purely financial investment/ In short, a good tax system encourages a balance of trade. It discourages foreign investment in a financial sense whilst encouraging investment in a real sense. An optimal taxation system would involve a collaboration between state and the private sector, so the gains of research and development investment are shared between both. And an optimal social security system would involve some funding from sovereign wealth funds, including personal accounts, so that the people and state accumulate assets to support them in hard times.

For this we need to provide an incentive for companies like Dyson to locate into the UK. We suggest the following: a *higher* corporate tax but calculated as follows: Sales - UK Wages - UK Investment. In other words, the tax should *encourage* uk companies to invest in the UK. We call this a DYSON TAX.The financial system should be encouraged to lend to real businesses.

3) *An affordable home in a prosperous community*. The third priority is an affordable home for all. British governments have massively mismanaged the taxation of housing and business properties. By appropriately taxing the value of the location (land), in a way that is convenient and fair for all, we make it possible for most people to have the economic benefits of owning their own home. An optimal tax system would encourage community action, so that 'community entrepreneurship' allows communities to develop their value and capture the fruits of this development. How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England?  How do we achieve this, given how expensive homes already are in South East England? 

Well the first thing is to capture location rent increases for public causes. What does this mean? That means that the property taxes: council taxes, business rates and stamp duty should be rolled up into a single tax. This should be a tax on property with the *value* of tangible investment deductible. So that means that a house is a value, so you shouldn't be charged on this. The residual should be allocated between the local community, the municipal authority and the central government. Taxing property values rather than property per se would stabilise the current property values. We have a LAND VALUE TAX payable in cash or deferred until sale or death.

4) *Secure incomes, productive jobs and economic power:* The current social security system is highly insecure: benefits are taken away from people when their conditions change, leading them often to go into arrears with their rent or other payments, and often leading them into debt. The current social security system also discourages work, as benefits are withdrawn as income increases (in the Universal Credit system at a rate of 61% for every £ increase in income). A better benefit would not be withdrawn so rapidly as income increases, would encourage people to increase their skill level, would be well integrated with the taxation system and would also support those who enhance their communities in ways other than simply earning money (for example by caring or raising a child). It would also allow division of labour with minimal taxation between individuals in communities (so eliminating the tax advantages of being a company relative to an everyday citizen).

The fourth priority is secure incomes, productive jobs and economic power. For this, we need to simplify the existing income and means-tested benefit system. Rather than the current system of means testing benefits, there would be a single system of basic income and taxation. A 'simplifying' basic income payable to everyone in society would be combined with a simplification of the system of income taxation, so that a standard rate of 40% is applied to all income up to the point when someone reaches the top 1% of incomes. Furthermore there would be citizen wealth funds, and assets would be granted to individuals based on how much tax they paid. There would be a 'target minimum level' of wealth and individual's tax would build up this minimum level of wealth. We have a SIMPLIFIED INCOME TAX, BASIC INCOME and WEALTH FUND.

## Plan of the Book

This chapter considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasizing where our ideas are new or innovative. . 

Chapter 2 considers economic reform and economic justice in history, starting with Adam Smith.

Chapter 3 outlines the principles of the Beveridge report. Like Beveridge, we want to produce a *radical, comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

Chapters 4 and 5 build a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the major important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. [To Be Implemented: Empirically we should ask the hypothetical question: *how would the world be different if this or that assumption were true*. We then use quantitative data to see which assumption is appropriate.]

Chapter 6 considers the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. *Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing any tax or system of taxation. Each covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions. It defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, good and practical tax system. 

Chapter 7 builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to fairly transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Chapter 8-14, consider the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality seems to be driven not only by difference in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation.  Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sector, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them. We then apply these ideas to the sectors of the economy.

Chapter 15 and 16, contain our proposals and the quantitative modelling work on them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented.  We outline our proposals model them and conclude the book in part 14. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.

# 2. ADAM SMITH: REVOLUTIONS OF MIND AND MATTER

## The Wealth of Nations

UNDER THE STARRY SKIES, far away from the everyday hustling and bustling of the commercial metropolis, sits a professor, beavering away at his manuscript. The year is 1773; the location Kirkaldy, a small town in Scotland; the author, Adam Smith. The full title of Smith's great work would be "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations".

On this cool and starry night, Smith was writing the fifth and final book of the "Wealth of Nations", entitled "On the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth". Smith asked: How should the activity of government be funded? Which taxes should a state impose? 

This book is devoted to similar questions: how should we fund the state? Which taxes should be levied and why? And related, what would make a better welfare system? We use taxation and welfare firstly as tools to preserve and enhance the wealth of the planet, of nations, of communities and of individuals. By wealth we mean the stock of valuable things, including the environment and individuals. And we are concerned also to distribute wealth fairly, partly by ensuring that wealth does not beget more wealth unless it is productively invested, and partly by ensuring that the transition to a fairer system is itself fair to all. Our immediate scope is the UK, but our ideas could be applied anywhere. 

So let's get back to our story. Tax is not just a matter of theoretical interest but has also been a driver of history.  Smith himself was agreed with the American revolutionaries that the colonies should be represented in the British parliament in proportion to the tax they paid. If Smith's book contributed to a revolution of ideas, in other parts of the world a more hot and imminent political revolution was brewing.

*Plaque marking the site of Adam Smith's mother's house in Kirkcaldy, where Smith lived*

WHILST SMITH WORKED by candlelight, far across the oceans, in what was then the British colony of North America, some demonstrators were heaping tea into the sea. The demonstrators' objection: the British state was collecting taxation without giving them representation in the British parliament. And so the American Revolution was born.

Revolution was also imminent in France. A century earlier, Jean-Baptist Colbert, minister of Finance to the King of France, had said that 'The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of squawking.' By 1789, the geese had not only squawked, they had overthrown the farmer and taken control of the farm. The French Revolution had arrived. 

## Rural Land and Urban Location

In France, one of the first economists, Francois Quesnay, had argued for a single tax on the value of land to replace all other taxes. The tax never happened, indeed Adam Smith commented both on its economic benefit and its political challenges when he said, with dry irony 'The single tax on land is the tax that does not threaten to discourage industry anywhere'

Let's take our magic carpet to cross the Atlantic and forward a century in time. A journalist in San Francisco is learning his craft. He is fascinated by a subject which was then still called 'political economy'. And he was interested in one question in particular: why was there so much poverty in the midst of so much technological progress? George looked out at the world, and he noted that it was in the biggest, most advanced cities, with the most technological advancement, which also had the worst, most grinding, poverty. The journalist's name was Henry George and his book was called Progress and Poverty. 

George's work echoed the more turgid prose of banker and great economic theorist David Ricardo. Ricardo had argued that an agricultural landlord contributed nothing to the well being of society: he merely extracted the surplus from the land once the costs of labour and tools had been paid. This surplus is known as rent. As had been previously argued by Adam Smith, the best tax therefore was a tax on rent. Whilst Ricardo modelled a rural economy, Henry George was concerned also with urban land. The ownership of urban plots allowed the landowners to benefit as society developed. George popularised the message that the remedy was to tax urban landlords. He used beautiful words that everyday folk could understand. 

Inspired by Henry George, a woman by the name of Elizabeth Magie, invented a game called the Landlords' game. It illustrated that without a tax on urban land, property tended to get 'monopolized' and those who owned it extracted rent from those who did not.Change this If however the people who owned land were taxed on the value of that land, then a stable and fair (if rather boring) outcome ensued. Later the game was shorn of the beneficial, but boring, rules, leaving only the case where an unstable and unfair (if at times fun) ruleset remained. Therefore the original political implications of the game name were lost and the new game was marketed as 'Monopoly'. The goal of Monopoly is of course to own the whole board and to drive all the other players bankrupt. This might make an exciting game but it was far from a system of widely spread prosperity. The case for a land value tax is considered later in this book.

## War and Progress

Henry George inspired many of his readers, including the young Winston Churchill and British first world wartime prime minister Lloyd George. Towards the end of the first world war, there was even a budget which implemented a Land Value Tax, the 'People's Budget'. But due to the resistance of land owners and the difficulties of valuation, the budget was never implemented. Nevertheless, from the late 19th century through the whole of the twentieth century, and particularly after the second world war, the conditions of the poor improved. The curse of slum landlords and destitution was almost banished.

One great milestone in this history of progress was the Beveridge report. Released in 1942 and chaired by Liberal economist Lord Beveridge, it laid the basis for the post-war welfare state. Its aim was to banish the five great evils: 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. OrderAfter the war, Beveridge's report inspired an improved social security (benefits) system, public education, public housing, a national health service and macroeconomic management aimed at ensuring full employment. 

The reforms inspired by Beveridge and other social reformers helped to reduce the prevalence of these five great evils, and transformed the previously hellish conditions of the poor. But we have not achieved heaven on earth. There are great evils facing us: the destruction of the environment, the lack of affordable housing in many towns, great inequalities of wealth and the risks of automation. This book will explain why these evils arise and how they can be fixed.

## The Global Machine and the Global Mission

We are now in the present day. The subject then called political economy is now called economics.  Great container ships cross the oceans. Aircraft zig-zag the skies. Massive machines in far off lands churn out phones and other devices which everyone is looking at. Many people live lives with more consumer comforts than the past. But some things are very expensive: it is expensive to buy a flat in London for example; but it is relatively cheap to fly off to sun-kissed beaches on foreign shores.

This great machinery of commerce is devoted to two purposes: to give people what they desire (or at least what they can be encouraged to buy); and to make a profit in so doing. The commercial machine is in many ways smooth. But there are rumblings of discontent.  In 1848 the 'spectre of communism' overshadowed the world, according to Marx. Today the danger of environmental destruction, runaway technology and a state run by and for the superrich to enrich themselves still further, overshadows this machine for happy fulfilment of our consumer desires.

In America, a man promises to 'drain the swamp'. It would be natural to take these words to mean that the army of smart-suited lobbyists, that aim to direct the ship of state to favour their interests, would be sent packing. Nothing of the sort happened. Indeed the swamp got ever marshier. The poor, who had seen nothing much of forty years of economic growth in US were increasingly addicted to prescription painkillers. In the United Kingdom and the United States people stopped living longer.

This was by now a truly global civilisation. And scientists were warning that something truly global was wrong. In a conference room, a group of scientists called out for the radical shifts to stop burning fossil fuels in a couple of decades. The great machinery of commerce, which had since the end of the second world war been devoted to giving us more and more stuff, would need to be turned around to a new purpose.  

To turn around this great global machine, this supertanker of consumer commerce, we need to apply not only the great resources of the state, but also the dynamism and capacity of the private sector. We need to harness the profit motive for the good of the planet. And for that we need to tax the damages that individuals and companies cause to the living planet. In this book we seek to use the tax system to do so, not only by changing the incentives of the private sector in one country, but also by ensuring that other countries have a reason to follow that lead. 

Yes. The reforms that we are proposing will transform the prospects of the first to adopt them that others will have no choice but to follow that lead.

## The Prices of Flats and of Flights

It's now a wet November evening. Let me introduce Peter and his wife Lucy, who are shivering in their North London flat, pressing refresh on their email program and looking at their phones. They are waiting to see whether their offer on a two bedroom flat in a rundown neighbourhood of the city has been accepted or not.

An advert flicks up for a getaway flight to somewhere sunnier. If they can take the time off, then they can get away to a nice sunny island for a week. The small flat they are purchasing is, by any normal standards, inordinately expensive. They will be paying off their mortgage until they reach retirement age. And the flight to the sun is cheap, they can book it for less than one day's wages each.

To Peter and Lucy this is the usual way of things, although they don't like it much. Their friend Mel pointed out to them that the world is running out of time to tackle one of the major environmental problems facing it, climate change. Lucy feels a certain amount of guilt in the back of her mind for taking a holiday and the associated carbon emissions but is convinced by the low cost of the flights. When buying a roof over their heads is so expensive and so stressful, any normal person would need a little relief. They book the flight.

This book is about the prices of things, and how the prices of things is influenced by the taxation system. Houses and flights already have some taxes on them. If you live in a house, you pay Council Tax. And if you take a flight you pay Air Passenger Duty. Putting a higher tax on houses may actually reduce the purchase price of the house. That's because the value of the house depends in part on the obligations associated with it, taxation included. 

This book does not argue for environmental taxes primarily to change the behaviour of consumers. Rather it seeks to change the economy to provide goods in ways that do not damage the living planet. Sometimes this will be difficult. It's hard to design aeroplanes that do not burn oil products. But technological change adapts to market need. And if zero carbon planes cannot be designed, then perhaps those who fly should pay for the capture of Carbon Dioxide from the air elsewhere. In other words, the tax on flying, and other activities that produce warming greenhouse gases, should be enough to encourage people to capture those gases from the air if they cannot be eliminated directly.

The price of things in short needs to be just. And a just price of things requires a just tax system. And a just tax system will cause people to pay for the damage they cause to the environment. And a just system will also ensure that nobody gets rich merely by owning some of the limited things of life, such as land. In short, justice and benefit are the same, fairness and efficiency merely two sides of the same coin. That is Tax Heaven. And it is to such a tax system that this book is devoted.  

There's a corny old joke about the man that asks for directions and gets the response "Well if I was going there I wouldn't start from here". So it's not just the final state of affairs that must be just, but also the approach of getting from here to there. In the later parts of the book, we show how to transition in a fair way to a just tax system.

# 3. BEVERIDGE: THE SOCIAL CONTRACT 

Further down the street from Peter and Lucy lives Fred. Fred is on benefits. He once took a job, but he found that once this happened his benefits were cut off. There was a gap between his new wage and the benefits coming in. Thanks to this he didn't have the money for the rent. The UK has rolled out a reform known as 'Universal Credit', which integrates four income-related benefits into one. The 'benefits withdrawal' rate (in effect the income tax on additional income) on Universal Credit is 'only' 63%, which means that you only lose two thirds of the extra income you got.

It does not have to be this way. One great milestone in the history of progress in the UK was the Beveridge report.  Seventy-five years ago liberal economist William Beveridge presented his report concerning a new welfare state in the UK to parliament. Commissioned in 1942 and chaired by liberal economist Lord Beveridge, it laid the basis for the post war welfare state to banish 'want, ignorance, squalor, disease and idleness'. It[-@Beveridge1942], laid the basis of the British postwar welfare state.Crucially, he argued for universal benefits, as of right, rasther than the system of means testing that has since developed. His report was guided by the following three principles [@Beveridge1942: Part 1, paragraphs 6-9].

First, he argued that World War II and its aftermath was 'a time for revolutions not patching'. He offered a radical approach, informed by the experience of the past, without being restricted by the interests of one group or another. In short, his report would be *radical* (working from first principles) and prioritise the common interest.

Second, he argued for a *comprehensive* solution to the five 'giant' social problems of the poor. His report dealt primarily with want (poverty) and disease (poor health). The other three 'giants' were ignorance (lack of education), squalor (poor housing), and idleness (unemployment). Accordingly his report laid the basis not only for the UK's postwar welfare (or social security) system, but also the National Health Service, public education, housing policy, and a system of macroeconomic management aiming for full employment. 

Finally, Beveridge argued that there should be reward for contribution and service. The social contract of the mixed economy involves *cooperation* between the State and the individual. The welfare system should not stifle incentive, opportunity or responsibility. It would be an insurance system, i.e. a system of *giving* in return for *subsistence* benefits as a universal *right* and *without* means-testing. The state would offer the security of a subsistence standard of living in exchange for *service* and *contribution*. Welfare benefits would not preclude individuals from employment or self-employment, and benefits would not be withdrawn as people earned more. The outcome of this in reality has been very different to what Beveridge intended.

In short, we could say that the Beveridge principles are as follows:

- *Radical*: From first principles, without fear or favour to social class or other interest groups.
- *Comprehensive*: Dealing with poverty, disease, bad housing, unemployment and a lack of education.
- *A liberal social contract*: No means-testing and so no stifling of incentives, but also cooperation between the state and individuals/firms.

World War II had almost bankrupted Britain. Britain had initially financed the war through borrowing both domestically and internationally, especially from the United States. However, despite a public debt ratio which peaked at 238% of GDP in 1947, and the gradual loss of its prewar Empire, postwar Britain soon rebuilt itself and managed to provide for its people a standard of living greater than that before the war. Pursuing a policy of low interest rates, moderate inflation and high growth, the burden of debt was cut to 70% of GDP in 30 years. These accomplishments are in themselves remarkable, and we will touch on how they were achieved later on in this book.

Beveridge was largely successful in his mission to lay the foundation for a comprehensive welfare state. However, some of his principles, especially the third, were unevenly applied. 

## **Principle 1: A Fundamental Review**

The premise of this book is to look at tax and welfare from first principles, and then to apply those first principles without fear and favour.

But are we at a revolutionary time? Can we change a complex system like tax and welfare from first principles, or is 'patching' the only realistic possibility? We will assert that change is possible only if it is beneficial, fair and smooth, and communicated well so that these aspects are evident.

One does not make fundamental progress without thinking fundamentally about what a system should do and what it should be. We also need to consider the motivation for, and the barriers to change. One barrier is undoubtedly the worry that some people will be made worse off by any changes. Therefore, we need to ensure not only that the final state is fair, but also fairness is upheld the transition between the current system and the new is also fair.

## **Principle 2: The New Five Great Challenges**

We still have Beveridge's giant social issues to some degree, but we are also faced with new problems. This book, like Beveridge's report, is devoted to five great societal challenges which face us now:

- *Wealth*: Inequality of income and wealth, and especially that caused by arguably unfair means; tax avoidance and evasion; dominance of large mega-corporations with market power enriching the rich and wielding political power. Dealing with the challenge of increasing automation of work so that everyone has an adequate income and plenty of free time.
- *High Rent on Land and Resources*: Unaffordability of renting or purchasing homes, and the cost of importing fossil fuels.
- *Pollution and other environmental damage*: Climate change, ocean acidification, plastics, overfishing and habitat loss which all threaten the future.
- *Debt and Economic imbalance*: Rebalancing the economy away from borrowing and asset inflation, and towards balanced growth and wealth formation.
- *Tax Evasion and Avoidance*: Can a tax system be designed that is simple and yet difficult to avoid?

## **Principle 3: A Social Contract Aligning Reward and Contribution**

Our new welfare system should not disincentivise work and should encourage service and contribution. We will study in detail Beveridge's third principle to see if, and how, a better welfare system can be created. 

This involves the *integration* of the tax system with the benefits system so there is not a separate system of 'means testing': this function can be carried out through the tax system. This suggests the case for a system with a universal component: we call this a 'citizen's dividend' (a form of basic income). Furthermore, we argue for an integrated skills training and work experience system. These two proposals are outlined in part 11.

## **From 'Universal Credit' to truly Universal Benefits**

Many voices have called not for Universal Credit but instead a basic income. The big difference with a basic income is that the benefits are paid whether you work or not. But is a Basic Income politically feasible. A 'simplifying' basic income scheme would increase income tax, including eliminating personal allowances, in order to pay for it. But is a basic income politically feasible? Most well functioning benefits systems do take benefits away from them if they do not work or pay taxes. But instead of the current system of conditionality we argue here for a system that degrades very slightly over time if the person does not pay taxes or do any other sort of worthwhile activity. Over time, this would transform into a sovereign wealth fund basic income, with individuals building up assets to fund the welfare payments.

# 4. DESERT ISLAND ECONOMICS

The purpose of this section is to take you on a whirlwind tour of some important ideas in economics and the history of economic ideas. We shall introduce these ideas through stories on a set of islands, which we will call The Economic Archipelago (the 'Tea Islands'). (In the subsequent chapter we will introduce these same ideas more formally using a different analogy: the cake.)

# 4.1 Growth on Great Island: Adam Smith's Model

The largest island in the Tea Islands is called 'Great Island'. On Great Island live a few hundred people. Everyone does the same thing, a bit of everything. Half the day is spent fishing (including maintenance of the boats and nets) and half the day is spent gathering nuts and berries. This yields 250g of fish and 250g of nuts and berries. In total, 0.5kg of food which is equal to their dietary needs. In this economic fable we will demonstrate Adam Smith's model of growth through specialisation.

## Specialization and Trade

Then a small group of fishermen discover something. They decide firstly, that they are *only* going to fish, and not worry about gathering berries. Whilst they enjoy nuts and berries, they argue that they can catch enough fish and *trade* some of the fish they gather for nuts and berries. They also split up tasks between themselves. Some of them make nets, others build bigger boats. They can catch more fish by splitting up tasks in this way. By collaborating and specializing they can double their productivity. Where before they could only make 500g of food per day, now they, collectively, can produce 1kg of food per day. 

They now have choices. The first option is to work all day (8 hours) and sell the surplus, either saving the excess or spending it on some luxuries. The second option is to cut down working hours by working only 4 hours per day. In the shorter working day they can still produce enough food to live on. In both cases the fishermen in the firm have higher hourly wages than before - twice what they were making before. These higher wages reflect the higher productivity. 

So the improvement was generated by the fishermen and their initiative, and they are the beneficiaries of the new ways of working. The economy has grown, but at present the new prosperity has gone entirely to the fisherman that initiated the improved ways of working. The price of fish relative to berries is unchanged. One kg of fish still sells for one kg of berries.

## Competition

So at first, the benefit of improvements are captured by those that made the improvement. They get to live a life of luxury. And everyone else is pretty much as before, except that they notice the specialised-fishermen getting richer and richer. 

Soon some other folks notice what the fisherman have done and give it a try. And then some more fishermen pile in. Fortunately the seas are plentiful. Once each has replicated the new improved double-productivity setup, they can each sell fish. But something strange happens. Given the people only want to buy a certain quantity of fish, the fishermen undercut each other in order to win market share. The price of fish in terms of berries starts to fall. 

## The Labour Theory of Value

To what price should the price of fish fall to? It continues to fall until the point at which, in the new circumstances, it only just makes sense for workers to go fishing in the new fishing-conglomerates. In short when the wages from fishing in the new improved setup equilibrate to the wages just going gathering. In other words, the price of fish relative to berries will fall until it makes the same sense for someone to fish as to go collecting berries. This assumes of course that there is some value in eating some berries, perhaps for a varied diet. 

So now, the cost of fishing is expected to fall. In the new circumstance perhaps, 1kg of fish (taking one day to collect) buys 0.5kg of berries (also taking one day to collet). Given the new cheaper price of fish relative to berries.

## Widely Shared Prosperity?

So at the end, people fish for a day to get 1kg of fish and perhaps go collecting for a day for 0.5 kg of berries. 2/3 of the people fish, and 1/3 of the people collect berries (a change from half-half before the imrpovement in capabilities.) The total average food production is 2/3+1/6=5/6 or about 0.82kg. Thus the real wages per day have increased as 0.5kg per 8=hour day to 0.82kg of food per 8 hour day.

This is shall we say the basic model of division of labour and competition. Let's now extend this model to the situation where there is scarce land which is privately owned.

# 4.2 Rent on Private Property Island

Our fisherman is considering a change of direction. He has heard that there are two new islands, only recently discovered, which sounds like a paradise. Rabbits run free and are easy to hunt. Fishing is rather laborious whereas hunting rabbits sounds much easier. Our fisherman sets out to visit the first island. The first island is one of private property.

On this island, there is a man, lets call him 'Man Friday' living on it. He is well abrest of the laws of property. He defines himself the owner of the property. He arms himself to make sure that nobody else can take any of the property. He prepares to charge rent to anyone who turns up. Thus we will call this island 'private land island'.

Then a new man turns up, we can call him Robinson Crusoe. This man has been used to living at sea in a fishing boat. Every day he fishes, he catches 1kg of fish, which, we can assume are very nutritious. 

Crusoe arrives at the island which is full of rabits which are easy to hunt. If he is to work a whole 8-hour day, he can now catch 8kg of rabbits. Let's say that a rabbit is just as nutritious as a fish, and the work is just as pleasant. In fact, he only needs 1kg of food to live on, so he can work one hour per day and relax reading books the rest of the time.

After the second day of fruitful hunting, Man Friday turns up to say hello. Fortunately through a twist of fate, they all speak the same language. Friday is very happy that Crusoe has turned up. He invites Crusoe round to dinner. It's a very beautiful dinner: rabbit en croute. Friday has many beautiful items on the wall, won from many years of selling rabbits to passing tradespeople. He even has a beautiful gun and half way through the meal, he gets it out of the gun holster to show Crusoe, places it on the table to show him, and then puts it back in its holster.

Dessert is served. Friday has a family of servants who help him. Friday is saying how he is glad that crusoe has joined the island. Half way through the desert, Friday gets to the point. "Oh about the rent" he says. "Would seven per day be ok?"

In a moment, the pleasant world of Crusoe disappears. He had not even considered that Friday would charge him rent. There was space enough on the island for all. But Crusoe had few options. The best profession he had found up to now, a fisherman, earned 1 kg of food for a full days work. Living on dry land seemed attractive (at least he was not subject to the storms). He had thought that he could work only one hour per day. But now he realised that his working hours would not change. The eight hour shift of fishing to get one unit of fish is the same as the eight hours he would have to work to get eight kg of food in the new situation, of which seven would go to his landlord! He would still wokr the same hours, and get the same pay. Admittedly the new situation was a little better as he was not subject to the storms and salt-corrosion of his boat, but it was not the bliss that he previously envisioned.

It's intreresting to note that the net wage after rent of our new arrival depends actually not on the conditions of the island, but rather on the conditions in his next best option, which is to go fishing. Suppose that fishing made 2kg of fish per 8 hour day (0.25 kg per hour). The landlord, observing this, would need to charge only 6kg of rabbit per day in rent, since Robinson Crusoe could always do better fishing otherwise. This is odd and worth repeating: the well being of someone here depends on the options that they have available elsewhere.

Thus we could see perhaps that the abolishion of traditional peasant rights in england during the enclosure acts could be the fundamental cause of poverty in big cities thereafter. Without the option to be a peasant, there was no options for workers to earn any sort of wage. Thereofre the wages paid by industrial capitalists need be enough to keep them alive, but no more - subsistence wages.

The landlord can extract *rent* constituting the surplus over wages (in this case the net resoirces kept by Robinson once he has paid his rent).

## Differential Rent

Imagine the island is split in two, one half is owned, the other is not. On one side of the island, rabbits are plentiful, and 8kg of rabbits per day can be hunted. On the other side, rabbits are less plentiful and only 4kg per day can be hunted. The landlord rents out both plots, but the rent charged on each can differ. Assuming for now that the wage that an unemployed person can make is still 1kg per day when fishing. Thus the landlord can charge 3kg of rabbits for residence on the less productive plot and still 7kg of rabbits per day for residence on the more productive plot.

## Absolute Rent

Let's say that for some reason there's a series of storms the people on the islands find it hard to catch fish. The landlords however have some spare resource - stored dried food - that they have accumulated over many years. They sell this food to the fishermen. In exchange the fishermen sell their boats to the landlords and rent them back. Now there is no rent-free way of earning a living. In this situation, land and other ways of earning a living are absoultely scarce. They have been bought up by the wealthy landlords.

We can consider two possibilities: the first is that there is a shortage of workers. In this case, there will be some level of scarcity in labour and therefore wages will be kept up. The split between the revenue going to the landlords for renting a boat and labour will depend on the 

Now of the 1kg of fish, only half a kg is retained, the other half is paid as rent for the boats. The residual wages are not now set at what the fishermen can earn in a rent-free existense, but rather the minimum that will keep them alive.

## Capital

Let's say that Robinson sets aside some of his wages not to live but to invest for the future. He works for a bit and then creates some rabbit traps. He has to invest his time in the traps but after making the traps, his productivity is doubled from 1 rabbit per hour to two; or from 8 rabbits per day to 16. 

It takes him one day to build the traps. The traps double his daily productivity to 16 rabbits per day: it increases his productivity by 8 rabbits. And the traps, when in use  themselves last 10 working days (80 hours) before they have to be completely replaced. 

Does this investment make sense? Let's work it out. Basically there's an investment of 8 hours of time, and this leads to 8 extra rabits per day for 10 days, in other words 80 extra rabbits. I give up 8 rabbits in the day to construct my trap, and I get back 80 rabbits. Let's say that I borrow the resources to make the traps, so I borrow 8 rabbits to pay the rent and feed myself the day I make the traps.

Thus my profit is 72 rabbits (assuming I continue to work a full day) per 10 day cycle, just over 7 rabbits profit per day, once the cost of my investment is taken into account.

At last Robinson Crusoe is happy! He is a great believer in hard work. He is working full days to pay the rent. He will continue to work full days. He can invest his time and create the traps and then after having paid back the time invested, there will be a surplus too! He can sell the spare rabbits to passing trades people or to Man Friday. And he can build up assets.

We are assuming that Crusoe has some financial buffer, some wealth to tide him over for the day that he is building his trap and therefore not hunting. If rent is payable daily, he  might be able to delay paying rent, he might be able to borrow some rabbits or other resources to pay rent, or he might invest his own stock of wealth until the investment pays back. 

So everything is going swimmingly well, he invests the time and he makes a surplus and soon enough he's selling the spare rabbits to passing trades people and building up a store of value. 

But there's a catch. Friday comes round, observes what is going on. He takes some photos. And soon enough some adverts go up in the Archipelago Gazette, the local newspaper for the islands. It's only with a passing ship that Crusoe sees them. The adverts say the following: make a fortune hunting rabbits! Earn 16 rabbits per day. He also reads the small print: requires 8 rabbits investment to make traps. Rent: 14 rabbits per day.

14 Rabbits! He's only paying 7 at the moment! What's coming? Sure enough there are some visitors at the island and they come around, friendly enough. The next day Man Friday invites Crusoe round for dinner again.... "About the rent"... he says. "I know you are enjoying staying here". He continues. " But the market is changing. Market rents are going up. I had an offer the other day for someone to pay double what you are paying. Of course, I prefer to go with you so I won't chuck you out as long as you pay what the market is saying. It's only 16 rabbits per day. You still make a healthy 2 rabbits profit (actually one after paying for your investments but let's skip that).

Note that it seems that *property* is the fundamental problem here. That is true. But as we will see, abolishing property causes its own problems....

# 4.3 Overhunting on Open Access Island

Let's now imagine another island. On this island there is no property rights. Anyone can hunt for rabbits anywhere. And like the island just mentioned, there is no landowner! Everyone comes to the island. 

In the beginning, everyone was happy. Wages, 8 rabbits per day, or one per hour, made everyone happy. The problem this time was that too many people came. Since land was not owned by anyone, everyone hunted the rabbits, and in the end too many rabbits were taken from the natural environment. 

Because everyone cared for themselves and not for other people many more people came to the island. And those people started to deplete the common pool of rabbits on which everyone relied.

One person hunting for rabbits depletes the stock of rabbits that everyone relies on.  There is an ecological collapse. Soon there are many fewer rabbits left. People start to have less food to eat. Those that can, leave.

Whereas on the island with private property, people are poor, but there's no mismanagement. People do work too hard however!

# 4.4 Inequality on Special Island

Let's say now that hunters vary significantly in their skill level. There's still a limited quantity of land, and a limited quantity of rabbits. It's just that some people are much better than others. If there had been unlimited rabbits or unlimited land, this doesn't seem to be much of a problem. But if there's limitations it seems to be more of an issue. The successful hunters increase the price of land, and they also pressure the rabbit population squeezing out more of the rabbits for themselves so there are fewer for others. The taxes we imposed do help a bit. They mean hunters need to get rich by hunting ability rather than by merely owning land. But in a limited environment, the good hunters don't just benefit from their own hunting, they also impact on the others. They raise the marginal price of land, and so make it more difficult for large families. And they hunt rabbits so that there is less to go around for the others. This justifies what we call progressive taxation.  Progressive taxation means taxing people that make more, more heavily.

# 4.5 Economic Justice on Dream Island

What good are we aiming at? One of the islands on our archipelago is an island of our dreams. The fruit is bountiful, the water is clean, the people are happy. Everyone has a house or can build one with their own money. Fisheries and forests are managed well. Some people are richer than others, but the difference isn't huge, and the people are rich or high status are those that have contributed the most to society. The community collaborates to ensure that the political system is not corrupt and governs the society well, the citizens trade with other islands and each other. There is work for all, but no-one has to work very long hours. The financial system supports beneficial activities, for example clean power and a recharging system for electric cars. Financially, people are secure with investments in the local factory, which, whilst its mostly robotised, provides everyone with a dividend to spend on the products that it and other factories produce.

What has this fantasy island got to do with our life here and now, and in particular our taxation system? Tax, we claim, can encourage the private sector towards this heavenly state. And it is not only tax and the social security system which we propose to reform, but also some elements of the financial, education and pensions systems. We do not however consider these systems in full: that we must leave to others to consider.

Now what can we say about tax on this island? Well, in simple terms, tax is fair and fairly simple and straightforward for everyone to understand. But the tax system in important ways, supports the rest of the economy, not only in how the revenue can be spent but also in the ways that the tax system creates the incentives for the economy to function correctly. The two main ways that the taxation system can be used are generally *redistributive* and *environmental taxes*.  We will get to our dream island again but let's go back to the other islands in our archipelago.

## Getting to Dream Island

Let's now work out our solutions to the problems that we have encountered. It's easiest to solve the problems before they get started: to set things up right from the start.

The first solution is a land value tax: a tax on rent. The landlord is taxed according to the surplus of each piece of land. He makes no money. There's no such thing as the landlord any more, really. Land becomes free to buy but the person that occupies it has to pay rent to the central authority.

What does the central authority do with the rabbits? There's two options: firstly the government could provide public services. Secondly, they could give the rabbits back to everyone, per person.

What about over-hunting? Well if rabbit hunting is a concern then a limited number of permits could be issued. Hunting rabbits could be constrained. Or put another way, a tax could be levied on hunting rabbits. 

On the propertied land, If the rabbits don't run freely between then it can be expected that the landowners/renters will themselves look after the rabbits on their own plots. Therefore a land value tax plus property solution with the taxes paying for service.

Alternatively, if the rabbits do run freely between plots, there will need to be a solution that constrains hunting.

# 5. CAKE ECONOMICS

In the last chapter we introduced an archipelago of islands and showed the different economic issues that come about. In this section we formalise these arguments in another way, in relation to the analogy of making a cake.

To illustrate clearly the issues that our society faces, we often use the analogy of the economy as a cake. 

We can generally classify the big economic problems into six main groups:

1. How big is the cake? The questions of *growth*.
2. How big a slice of the cake does each economic actor get? The problem of *distribution* of income and wealth between classes and individuals.
3. From what is the cake made? The problem of *allocation* of real resources to make the economic cake.
4. Does the cake as a whole rise to its full potential? -- The problem of achieving full employment and sufficient *demand*.
5. How much can we charge for our cake slices? The *price of goods*.
6. How much is the cake shop worth? The *price of assets*.

Tax policy intersects all six of these issues. We want to design tax and welfare policy that leads to a successful economy in the long and in the short term, that allocates resources appropriately, and that leads to a just and appropriate distribution of income.

# 5.1 Growth: How big is the cake?

Growth is the problem of 'how big' the economy is, how much wealth and prosperity there is. First we have to define the problem. What should we measure? Francois Quesnay defined the 'tableau economique' which was the originator of the modern concept of Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. We will stick to real income as a measure of economic success, following Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations, perhaps the first systematic approach to working out what makes the economic pie bigger. Whilst Smith's perspective (and that of growth theory generally) is about increasing the income of an economy, we might also consider the question of the stock of wealth in an economy. By wealth in this context, we don't just mean financial claims, but rather the wealth of the whole country or world. 

There are, broadly, three proposed solutions to the problem of growth: acumulation, division of labour, and capability more generally.

Growth can be driven by accumumulation: more capital; more people (population growth); or more nature ie the extraction of more material energy or other materials from the earth. In each of these cases, we are explaining more 'output' from more 'input'. How much of economic growth can be explained by more input? Solow defined his famous growth model where he considered how much of economic growth could be explained by capital and labour accumulation. His result: accumulation could only explain a small amount of economic growth. He named the residual 'technology'; but in fact this residual consists of a number of factors which we now consider.

Adam Smith made  use of the principle of division of labour in his Wealth of Nations [@smith1776wealth]. By dividing up the manufacture of pins into many steps, each step could be more productive. Smith's competitive approach could be contrasted with earlier Arab economist Ibn Khaldun, considered the division of labour as a way for cooperation to enhance the goods provided in a society  [@Olah2018]. Division of labour makes each step of the production process more efficient, requiring less labour for a given level of output. 

Whilst a 'labour theory of value' cannot explain all the differences in prices between goods, labour is generally the most important element in the prices of goods. As Samuelson, quoted in Blaug [@blaug1997economic] puts it "The operational significance of a one factor model is the importance it gives to technology". Translating this into simple English, as labour is the most important factor, using less of it can raise real incomes. When we divide labour, we increase efficiency. Two people doing separate parts of a more finely divided production process is more efficient than one person doing both tasks. We can also say, therefore, following Smith, that increasing the *size* of a market can also increase wealth, because a larger market, with lower transportation and exchange costs, can divide labour more finely. This is also an argument for free trade.

We can also say that technology is a public good, created by R&D and science. Finally, we should talk about capability more generally. Charles Babbage argued that the economic success of a society was dependent on a 'capability triad': production capabilities, business organisation and economic governance [@Hilton2017]. Therefore success requires a certain amount of activism by government: to promote capability in industry, good management and good governance.

## Implications for the Tax and Welfare System

What are the implications of all this for taxation policy? Smith himself argued that a good tax system should minimise the discouragement that a tax causes to economic activity.

We can say ourselves the following things:

1. Tax should minimise the barriers to division of labour; and should not discriminate in favour of companies over markets between individuals;
2. Tax should encourage the accumumation of skill and physical capital investment^[this latter point is not uncontroversial given increasing automation, and depends on wide ownership of capital]
3. Tax should encourage the development of capability.

# 5.2 Distribution: How big a slice does each person get?

The final big question that we consider is that of distribution. Distribution typically refers classically to the distribution of the economic cake between those that own land (landowners), those that own companies or other non-land wealth (capitalists) and those that only own their own working time (labour). We covered this in Chapter 1.6, so we will only make a few more comments here.

It is important to distinguish between justified and unjustified Wealth. Justified wealth consists in wealth that is derived from work, the creation of some product of value (or at least wanted) in society - the provision of goods and services. Unjustified wealth consists in effectively extracting the wealth of others. Such wealth is not acquired by the addition of anything valuable to the economy, but rather is gained from endowments or second-hand value creation. 

## Who Really Pays A Tax? Economic Incidence of Tax and Spending

Another important aspect of distribution is who pays a tax. Taxes are not always paid by those who are the immediate tax payer. In general the theory of incidence suggests that taxes are paid by the most inflexible factor: e.g land, other monopolies.

But public spending also does not always benefit economically the initial recipient. If public services are shared over some area where high quality land is scarce, then it will be the landowner who benefits, not the direct individuals who are tenants. Whilst the advantages of living in an area may go up with better public services, if landlords can charge higher rents in so doing, then the benefit of increased spending may go on increased rent. The Henry George theorem states, that under certain conditions, the beneficiary of all public spending is the landowners. This effect can be seen in practice with a new railway link. In fact, in Hong Kong, new links on the metro are financed by purchase of land near new stations. This provides another justification for taxing the unearned increment on land value.

## Persistent Profit from Companies

We have already discussed land in some detail. But we should also consider taxing other forms of profit, from companies. Some situations are natural monopolies; others are government created types of monopoly, and finally the dynamics of some production and sales processes naturally favours larger firms.

All situations where an individual or company has some non-replicable advantage can make something similar to rent. Profits can be competed away, rents are permanent. So we sometimes see the phrase 'rent' used in other situations than land, to mean the permanent component of profit. Warren Buffett makes this explicitly: he seeks companies that have a 'moat' to their 'castle', the castle being the profits made and the moat being the barriers to other companies competing away their profit. 

Taxes on profits, especially persistent profits, therefore make a lot of sense. We need to find a way that these profits taxes can't be taxed away.  Finally some firms such as Amazon make a return without making profit at all, by capturing market share they force out the opposition creating a global form of monopoly. So we will need to find a way to tax corporate wealth independent of profit. We cover these these topics in Part 7 on Corporations and in our proposals (Part 12).

# 5.3 Allocation: From What Should the Economic Cake Be Made?

Governments influence the allocation of economic activity two main ways:

- First, governments spend money, therefore directly allocating what is done. They can also lend themselves or direct lending of the financial sector.
- Second, governments create the systems of tax and regulations which guide and directs the private sector.

In both senses, it's important that public goods are taken into account.

Economists often talk of value, by which they usually mean *private value*, which is the benefit generated by someone producing goods and services; and the benefit the consumer receives from buying them. Economists also speak of 'public goods' as those which have various characteristics. The first is that we can't avoid consuming them for better or worse. Also, consuming them does not preclude others from doing so (they are non-exclusive). Some public goods have neither of these characteristics, yet are still provided publicly.

All these reasons provide justification for public goods to be created and shared. Taxation is a way of funding those public goods. However, tax and spending is not the only way of providing public goods. Charities, civic society, individuals and culture can all provide public goods, and the provision of private goods and services as a whole can also be seen as a public good. For example, a locality where there are lots of easily available shops and other services is a kind of public good, because those private goods assist each other in benefiting the people who live there.

## Implications for the Tax and Welfare System

Creating the right incentives is key to influencing people to behave in a beneficial manner, and the tax system is largely a system of incentives and disincentives. Strangely, the current system incentivises activities we don't want and disincentives activities we do want. To improve people's choices, we have to change these incentives.  We should tax activities that are harmful to others or to the natural environment. This will both reduce/discourage the negative activity and make the actor 'internalise' the harm done by the activities. It will help create a fair playing field for less harmful competitors. There are two types of harmful activity which could be taxed:

- Activities that harm others or the environment: in these cases activities should either be banned (now or in a forward-looking sense) or taxed;
- Activities that harm the individuals themselves such as smoking or excessive sugar and meat consumption: here we need to create a benevolent environment for the individual that does not encourage the harmful activities. This includes having the right incentives especially for the corporate sector (e.g. a sugar tax impacting the composition of breakfast cereals).

# 5.4 Demand: Does the cake rise to its full potential?

Tax and Welfare are important. They are the principal tools by which governments raise revenue to provide public goods and support the poor.  However, taxes must be justified on some basis, if they are to exist at all. The common answer is that tax is needed to pay for common services. 

More generally, taxes are needed because two classes of goods exist in society: private and public. Private goods are those provided by the market economy: i.e. by individuals and companies when acting in a commercial capacity. Public goods are those that benefit us all, like a secure country and public infrastructure. We need taxes to pay for and regulate public goods. The tax system is intended to raise revenue for the provision of public services. 

But this is not the only viewpoint on the primary purpose of taxation. 

## MMT 

Modern monetary theory (MMT) argues that the purpose of taxation is slightly different. The purpose of taxation according to MMT is to mop up money that is created by public spending. This is an unusual perspective because most people believe that the government needs to tax or borrow money before they can spend it. From the perspective of MMT by contrast, money is simply a collection of tokens acceptable in the payment of taxes and created by public spending in the first place. 

The purpose of taxation within MMT is to control inflation. If more money is issued than there is demand for, the value of that money will degrade relative to the real economy. This means, that even with an MMT perspective, there presumably needs to be some taxation. MMT supporters generally believe that the government can and should run a fiscal deficit but that this deficit is limited by the effect on inflation rather than some requirement for 'austerity' to keep the public debt down. 

So, even proponents of MMT believe we need taxation. But taxation is not the only way to fund the government. There are many options, including fees for govt services, charging rent etc. But the usual options are taxation, issuing bonds, or printing money. On a basic level, we need to tax roughly as much as the government spends. There could be a fiscal deficit, but it should be of a moderate level in normal times.

## Fiscal Deficits

The MMT perspective is similar to thar of 'functional finance' as described by Abba Lerner. According to this perspective, the purpose of the government deficit is to keep the economy running at full capacity [@Lerner1943]. Government debt will take care care of itself as long as the economy is growing. This is a perspective born out by the post-war experience. (See part 10)

What we are dealing with here is the problem of the correct amount of (effective) demand. Effective demand is really the amount of spending power that agents have in the economy. The government can influence this in two ways: through fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy is the overall budget balance of the government. When governments borrow more than they spend, this increases the budget deficit, which also increases the spending power of those in the economy. 

Monetary policy involves changes to interest rates, which effects asset values. It also effects the exchange rate. In low-interest rate environments, fiscal policy is particularly effective and monetary policy less so ('pushing on a string' in Keynes's vivid phrase).

Thus these two forms of macroeconomic policy (fiscal policy and monetary policy) can both be used to help guide the economy, and solve the short term problem of effective demand i.e., 'how much does the cake rise'.

Our goal here is not to discuss fiscal policy specifically: we assume here that the overall fiscal balance (the difference between spending and taxation) will be determined correctly. Our scope here is the long term matter of *how* to tax, not the short term matter of *how much* to tax.

## Implications for the Tax and Welfare System

So what are the implications of the macroeconomics of effective demand for tax policy? Firstly, tax policy, in redistributing income and wealth, can increase effective demand and growth. Second, management of the public debt is vital and should be considered in more detail, both from a fiscal perspective and from the point of view of the effects of interest rates on other asset classes (and therefore the interaction with taxes in these areas). In short, low interest rates increase the asset prices in other areas, and that effect can be mitigated by taxes in these areas. So reducing interest rates can be combined with a land value tax and higher taxes on companies.

# 5.5 Selling Cake Slices: The Price of Goods

Modern economics as taught tends to consist at an elementary and intermediate level of the marginalist analysis of Alfred Marshall. (At an advanced level it also includes the more complicated and mathematic treatment of Leon Walras's 'General Equilibrium' analysis. Here we focus on partial equilibrium)

What does this analysis consist of? And what is the relation to classical analysis? Let us consider John Stewart Mill's writing (as mentioned in Mark Blaug's book) because his theory shows that the later classical and neoclassical theory of price determination are equivalent. The classical theory is in some sense just bringing out special cases of the neoclassical theory. But those special cases are important. They are the distinctions that really make a difference.

OK, so let's first describe the neoclassical (Marshallian) theory. he neoclassical theory is very simple to describe: price is set at the intersection between supply and demand. 

As the price goes up, the amount demanded will, in general, fall. It goes down because fewer people are willing to pay.

The supply curve represents the amount of a particular good that will be supplied by firms at different price levels. So as the price of the good increases, it is in general assumed that there will be more firms able and willing to supply the good, and more of that good can be supplied.

## Classical Theory in Neoclassical terms

The classical theorists also had a theory of price and they focussed mostly on the supply side of the coin. Mill suggests three separate possible outcomes: the first when supply is in inelastic, the second when there's a completely competitive market and finally the last, when there's some diminishing returns, i.e. that the cost of production increases when the amount required increases.

The first case is the easiest. Imagine there is a completely fixed supply of something. For example, there's some plot of land in a desirable location. None of the locations around it are quite the same, and in any case, they are in limited supply also. Since the supply is fixed, the demand for that land is determined by the price that the market is willing to pay, and not by any cost of production (since there is no production: it's fixed in supply)

The second case is also straightforward. Imagine that there is a product that has a fixed cost of production and is made by a large number of competitive producers.

The final case is of diminishing returns. Imagine that there's some good, let's say oil, that is easy to produce in some places (say Saudi Arabia), but hard to produce in others (deep water drilling and oil shale). In the easy places, the cost of production is low, in the hard places the cost of production is high. In this case, the price of the good will be determined by the cost of production of the marginal producer, which is in turn determined by the demand schedule.

So the price of oil is determined by the cost of producing a marginal extra barrel of the market-demanded amount of oil. Of course the market demanded price of oil is itself dependent on price. That's why we intersect the demand and supply curve to see what's the price of oil. [Maybe change the above to grain instead??]

## Implications for Oil

Imagine we had a closed economy with a single government. The oil market shows the two types of taxes that could be imposed. A land value tax would be a tax on the surplus profit from owning some piece of land when oil is on. It does not shift the point of intersection but rather merely taxes the net profit of producing oil.

# 5.6 Selling Cake Shops: The Price of Assets

Now we mentioned that ownership of land gives rise to a surplus. But what about the value of the land? What would that be? We can consider therefore ownership of land as conferring that surplus. What should the value of that set of surplus flows be?

One method for analysing this is known as discounted cashflow analysis. This computes the value of a set of cashflows according to interest rates seen in the economy. So for example the value of a piece of land that pays £5000 per annum might be computed as 5000/r, where r is the long term interest rate. So for an interest rate of 0.05, the total value would be 5000/0.05 or £100,000. At a lower interest rate of 0.02, the value wold be 250,000.

What about if the value increases in time? Let's say that the rent goes up by 1% per year. In this case, the formula again wold be very simple a/(r-g) where g is the growth rate and r is the long term interest rate

# 5.7 Beyond the Cake: A New Economics

In order to understand why the system is working the way it is, we need to take a look at the the tool-kit used to build it: mainstream neoclassical economics. 

Mainstream economics treats the world as being full of rational people, all looking to best maximise their own personal utility. This utility maximising tendency is the engine behind the flows of demand and supply that interact in efficient markets and influence price levels that then help distribute scarce goods in a  manner. However, people are not always rational, and markets are not always efficient. 

What does that mean for this brand of economics then? Clearly, a lot is missing.

Here we highlight three missing aspects: time, space and life.

## Time

Time is important because much economic activity is about storing value for the future. An example in simple terms would be when an individual stores financial assets (such as money) in a bank and the economic system grows these funds in investment opportunities and ensures that society, as a whole, increases its stock of wealth. That's the theory anyhow. One important factor in economics is ensuring that all this works effectively.

## Space

Space is important for two reasons. Firstly, each square metre of earth's surface is unique. It cannot be replicated. Thus, ownership of such a piece of land represents a monopoly in that it cannot be replicated.  Secondly, we all share in space. This means we all share in generating public goods in the space around us. This includes those created by the public and private sectors. We also share in creating public bads in the space around us, such as pollution.

Time and space interact with real estate. Since land is an infinitely lived monopoly (each piece of earth's surface is unique and lasts forever, for all practical purposes anyway), it has special features in terms of low interest rates. In other words, land is a long-lived asset and it becomes very valuable in low-interest rate environments. This was demonstrated in the follow up to the financial crisis.

## Living Systems

Life is the third class of elements missing in mainstream economic thought. Living systems are fundamentally different from non-living systems. Living systems are typically in a state of homeostasis rather than equilibrium. This is a steady state which requires active maintenance and energy input.  For example,  it takes energy to maintain a constant body temperature of 36.7 Celsius. Biological systems also require certain environmental conditions and cannot exist beyond certain ecological limits. Ecological economics considers that human economy is embedded in nature and it argues for a sustainable economy that would also exist in a steady state ^[This alludes to an ecological / steady state economics approach. See: http://www.steadystate.org/discover/definition/]. So life is not only a crucial element to our planet that we need to preserve, but also a rich set of understandings of the fundamental nature of things. So just like 19th century and 20th century economics often uses analogies from the physical and engineering worlds, we need a new set of understandings based on the nature of life itself.

Human systems develop *capability*, and this capability is embodied in individuals, companies, networks and whole societies. Understanding capability both for private and public ends can allow us to progress further.

# 6. ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS: PRINCIPLES OF GOOD TAXES

# 6.1 Great Economists on Taxation

So how should we apply economics to tax? Many economists have considered what an ideal tax system should look like and much has been written about how practically to implement these principles. Adam Smith is perhaps the most famous economist of them all. Smith's four axioms of taxation are that taxes should be convenient, objective, low cost both in terms of direct costs and the discouragement the cause to others, proportional to ability to pay. Smith [-@smith1776wealth, Book V, Chapter I] argued that:

> "Good taxes meet four major criteria. They are (1) proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay (2) certain rather than arbitrary (3) payable at times and in ways convenient to the taxpayers and (4) cheap to administer and collect."

We consider these canons of tax further in part 5 of this book. A tax on land rents is mentioned by Smith as amongst the optimal tax:

> "Both ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of revenue which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of the state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of industry. The annual produce of the land and labour of the society, the real wealth of the great body of the people, might be the same after such a tax as before. Ground rents and the ordinary rent of land are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax upon them"

David Ricardo [-@ricardo1821principles], Henry George [-@George1879], John Stewart Mill [-@mill1848principles], and Alfred Marshall [-@marshall1890principles] have also argued for the advantages of taxing land rent. Frank Ramsey [-@Ramsey1927] extended the argument to commodities in general, developing a formula for optimal taxation such that those commodities most inelastic in supply or in demand should be taxed the most. 

Meanwhile Arthur Cecil Pigou [-@Pigou1924] developed the idea of taxing externalities - situations, as pollution, when an economic activity damages others not involved in a transaction. Keynes's Polish contemporary Kalecki argued that taxation of wealth would increase effective demand and therefore economic growth without stifling incentives [@Kalecki1937]. And more recently Piketty [-@Piketty2014a] has shown the consequences for the growth in inequality if wealth and high income are not sufficiently taxed.

There have also been a number of comprehensive reports into practical taxation. In the UK there was the Meade Review into direct taxation [@Meade1977] and the Mirrlees Review into taxation in general [@Mirrlees2010d], [@Mirrlees2011]. There have also been similar reviews in Canada [@Carter1966], the United States [@Bradford1977] and, more recently, in Australia [@Henry2010] and New Zealand [@evans2011reflections].

Standing on the shoulders of these giants, we argue for two general principles. First, that the allocation of capital needs to account for costs and benefits to society as a whole, rather than just private profit within the system of property rights that we have at present. Second, that the ownership of assets and the return from the ownership of assets needs to be distributed widely. 

Turning more specifically to tax, economists would say that we should tax *externalities* and *economic rent*. In simple language, if an individual or company pollutes the environment, they should be prosecuted or should pay a tax. Landlords put up rent as wages grow and should also be subject to higher taxation. Finally, as companies get bigger and bigger, they often can set high prices and cut costs at the same time, buying up or forcing out the competition and gaining market power at the cost of everyday people. This is a further possible base for tax.

# 6.2 A Tripartite Framework for Taxes

What are taxes really for? What makes a good tax system? Is there such a thing? These questions remain unexplored for many people for whom taxes are just an inevitability, a necessary evil, and a yearly burden. As the old saying goes - there is nothing so certain in life as death and taxes.

There are those, of course, for whom the very concept of tax raises strong passions. Staunch libertarians claim that taxation is the blatant theft of private property, while social democrats often consider taxation to be a moral matter in the redressing of the unfairness of the free market. Emotions can therefore run high in debates on the purposes of taxation, and there often appears to be little common ground. This can make discussions of the philosophical basis of taxation somewhat difficult. But it is into this fraught debate that we are attempting to venture, with a hope to outline principles on which all (or most) will agree.

So if we assume, for now, that taxes are a necessary evil, then we must establish some guiding principles on how they should be applied. As our starting point, we have chosen three core characteristics which we suggest that all and every tax should possess. Taxes should be *beneficial*, *practical* and *fair*.

## Beneficial (Not Harmful)

To be beneficial is to do good overall. There are multiple ways in which different taxes might be said to 'do good', and people may fairly disagree on what 'good' means. However all taxes must have some legitimate claim to be beneficial. Most would agree that a tax is beneficial if it pays for valued public services. For example, taxation that pays for our National Health Service, our emergency services, our roads, schools and public transport, is generally considered necessary and beneficial. This is evidenced by a recent survey of British citizens [@PWC2017] which found that the majority would be willing to pay more tax if it lead to improvements in the quality of the NHS. 

More contentiously, taxation may be said to be doing good by redistributing income (or at least ensuring that the rich contribute more), helping to alleviate poverty, and reducing large wealth disparities. Tax may be used to ensure a minimum standard of living by providing an income 'safety net'. 

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behaviour by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage our natural environment, and health, by polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. So by taxing harm, it encourage companies to include these costs in their decision making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or investing to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such land. Of course, if tax is not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Instead the private sector, specifically, the existing owners will ration the resources through increasingly higher prices (rents), and in so doing provide unearned value or income to those who control them. Taxation can be used to fairly ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced, so that the country benefits as a whole.

Taxes can also be used to discourage antisocial and harmful behaviour by individuals and companies. They may do this by compelling those who cause harm to society through their economic activity to pay for that harm. A contemporary example is a carbon tax, which might be imposed on companies whose actions damage the natural environment and health of all citizens by polluting the atmosphere on which we all depend. Such a tax would encourage companies to find less polluting ways of doing business. Taxes which operate in this way are often said to 'internalise' social costs by forcing economic actors to pay for harms they cause. So by taxing harm, it encourage companies to include these costs in their decision-making process. The taxes gathered could also be used to undo some of the harm caused, such as by subsidising non-polluting sources of energy or by creating pools of investment to alleviate the problems caused by pollution.

Related to these other purposes, taxes might also serve the purpose of rationing scarce resources. One oft-used definition of economics is 'a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means' [@robbins1932]. Taxation can be used to fairly ration resources which are inherently limited, such as land. Of course, if taxes are not used for this purpose, land will still be limited. Lacking this, the private sector, specifically the existing ownership class, will ration these resources through increasingly higher rents, and as the rents go up, so will the sale price. In this way unearned income and capital gains will accrue to those who control the scarce resources. Taxation can be used to fairly ration economic rents from resources which are common or publicly enhanced, so that the country benefits as a whole.

## Fair (Just)

There are three ways in which we think taxes must be fair: consistency, progressivity, and justice in transition. 

The first is that they must be fair in the sense of being consistent. Identical persons, companies and situations should be treated identically. There should be no special exemptions or 'sweetheart deals' for favoured individuals or companies. As we shall see in the section on corporation tax, this principle can be flouted by particularly big or powerful companies.

Related to this idea of fairness are concepts of accountability and transparency. Taxes must not just be fair, but must be seen to be fair. Thus taxes should be clear and transparent, such that it is apparent to everyone what the proper tax burden should be for each income bracket. These issues are particularly topical in Britain today. In early 2017, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee expressed concern that HMRC's 'lack of transparency' concerning high net worth individuals 'has eroded public trust in a fair tax system' [@HoC2017].

Another, perhaps more controversial, kind of fairness concerns *progressivity*. A progressive tax is a tax in which those who have more, pay more. UK income tax is thus a progressive tax as richer citizens pay more proportionally than poorer citizens. We think that this is fair and thus we believe that taxes should be fair in the sense of being progressive. However, this viewpoint is not without controversy.

Fairness is also relevant to our discussion of economic rents and land values. When land values increase because of work performed by society as a whole by our definition it would be fair if all citizens benefit. It would seem unfair for only some people to benefit. Similarly, it would seem unfair if only a few people benefited from the country's natural resources - resources which were not created by any person, but which form part of the wealth of the nation as a whole. 

Finally, fairness is necessary in the transition from the existing system to the new system. This is necessary not only for reasons of justice, but also the political feasibility of the reforms: if they are seen as unfair to people here and now, they would be unpopular.

## Practical (Functions Smoothly)

If a tax was fair and intended to do good, but couldn't be implemented without requiring masses of paperwork, or prohibitive costs, or extreme social controls, then no matter the benefit, it would not be justifiable. Taxes must be practical to implement. There are many aspects to practicality and we cover them here. When considering whether a tax is practical, we might consider how close it is to a theoretical ideal. 

Ideally, a tax should be simple to implement and administer. It also should have low collection and compliance costs. This means that it should not cost the government huge sums to collect, and it should also be very easy for taxpayers to comply with. The less paperwork, time-consuming research and confusing the rules involved, the better. Taxes which are automatically collected are more practical in this regard than those which require large amounts of form-filling and record-keeping. 

Another aspect of practicality is predictability. Individuals and companies must be able to predict future expenses in order to arrange financial matters. 

In a similar vein, taxes must be clearly defined so that taxpayers can plan their affairs while knowing exactly how much tax they can expect to pay. One example which has been a particularly hot topic in recent years concerns tax evasion. Tax avoidance is the *legal* dodging of tax; tax evasion is the *illegal* dodging of tax. It is clear that a tax which is easily evadable or avoidable will not be practical because it will not function to increase public funds, and may require significant resources to be wasted chasing up non-complying 'tax cheats'. 

# 6.3 Appendix: More detail



David Ricardo was one of the great economic theorists. To distribution of the economic pie he put together a model of different land qualities and their respective qualities and thus rents. He recommended a tax on landowners rent.

Henry George also recommended a tax on land rent. He extended Ricardo's reasoning to urban land. He noted that the speculators always would win, at the expense of everyday people.

Tax theory
Frank Ramsey, a mathematician and economic limits polymath, wrote a paper on commodity taxation. His paper argued for the inverse elasticity rule: the amount of taxation payable on a commodity would be proportional to the sum of the reciprocal of the demand and supply elasticity for that good.

Arthur Cecil Pigou argued for taxes on externalities; that is, when one actor affects another without paying the price.

After WW2, progressive income tax systems. Lord Beveridge argued for a 'cradle to grave' system of social welfare.

In 'how to pay for the war' Keynes argues for sone practical measures. In the end, he got his wish for the 'euthanasia of the renter', as startling bonds and money lost a lot of their real value as the massive national debt was deflated and grown away.

Keynes's contemporary polish economist Kalecki argues for a tax on 'capital' (wealth) on similar grounds. He argued it would be macroeconomically stimulating to the economy to do so.

More recently, Piketty argues for a wealth tax both to provide useful information on the wealth endowment of rich people and to reduce the inherent advantages that wealth brings.  

Great reviews of taxation and benefits 

From time to time there have been major studies on taxation reform commissioned by various governments or learned think tanks. The most famous was perhaps not one in tax at all but rather welfare: the Beveridge review.

But apart from that, there have been a number of reports. One is the Meade review into direct taxation.. it recommends a so called cash flow taxation system of taxing consumption. This idea has been followed up more recently in the contributors to the Mirrlees review.

The Mirrlees review recommended something on similar lines but less radical: a deduction for the normal cost of capital. It also recommended a land value tax to replace business rates, a proportional property tax to replace council tax and stamp duty,

There were also tax reviews in Canada and Australia and New Zealand.

In Canada, the review argued for income tax on the basis of discretionary economic power. This meant that Subsistence would not be taxed.

There have also be economists who have considered the utility basis of taxes: to what extent does income make is happy? Thornstein(???) Veblen notes the phenomenon of 'conspicuous consumption'. More recently, Fred Hirsch's 'the social limits to growth' indicated how many of the things we value are so called 'positional' goods: being the best ballerina for example. 

Robert Frank's 'the Darwin Economy' notes that utility inniological terms is often positional and relative. This he argues has strong implications for taxation: we should tax luxury consumption.

In terms of environmental taxation, many IPCC reports mention the need for a carbon price (either a tax or tradeable quotas). Fred Coase is often considered the intellectual progenitor of the notion of assigning 'property rights' to the right to emit pollution.

The Green Fiscal Commissiom in the UK has looked into in detail the possibilities for taxing environmental bads. In this it overlaps with the Mirlees review which called for effective carbon pricing and

The ExTax project in the Netherlands looked across extraction and pollution at the whole range of environmental and resource taxes. On the other hand 'Carbonomics' considers the resource rent impact of environmental taxes.

Land value tax has recently had a resurgence, with the publication of Rethinking the economics of land and property, and many reports by the New Economic Foundations and others.

Financial and Money taxes are also significant. 'Spiritual economics' argues for a tax on money balances, a sort of negative interest rate. In this he echoes the work of Silvio Gesell who argued for demurrage' on money, or 'stamp scrip'. Indeed this was implemented and proved a success in Worgl, Austria.

We might say there are four major contributions to optimal taxation, focused on land value taxation, commodities taxation, externalities taxation and optimal income taxation.

Going further back we might say that land value taxation is close to the Islamic tradition of the Zakat, whereas Optimal Income Taxation could be seen to reference the income tax system.

# 7. THEORIES OF CHANGE

How do we change a system like tax? This book deals with tax reform in two approaches. The first is a 'blank slate' approach. This considers how we would define a tax and welfare system in an ideal world where both efficiency and fairness are achieved easily. 

The second approach takes into account issues of improvement and transition. In other words, what practical politically feasible changes could be made right now to make the system more beneficial and fair?

So what does practicality look like? Often in policy, it is synonymous with political feasibility. Previously, we mentioned the idea of political realism and transitional justice. Changes must not seem both unfair and have obvious losers. Fairness will be often perceived to be a matter of *transition* as opposed to the sort of a perspective we might have when trying to create a tax system from a 'blank state' (as we do within this book). 

The tax system seems to change through top down directives, through the intervention of the chancellor of the exchequer of the time. This approach means that the tax system often changes with the agenda of 'budget day' announcements. Of course,the secrecy around these announcements is to a degree necessary: if agents know how the tax system is going to change, then they may be able to take steps to avoid the taxes. A better approach would be to conduct a strategic tax review, much in a similar way to the strategic defence review.

Any discussion of taxation and welfare needs to consider *political realism*. What is political realism? It's recognising that some policies are politically easier to implement than others. In the context of taxation and welfare, we need to consider *transitional justice* and in particular not make any major groups worse off (except those that had previously benefitted unfairly). So, for example, it might be argued that a 100% land value tax is appropriate in certain locations, but to impose such a tax immediately would be unfair on those people who had recently purchased a house in the last year in a high land value area.

So what would it take to make change happen? I argue here that we need:

1. Political desire for change, a broad public consensus that there is a wrong that needs to be righted.
2. A shared narrative understanding of the principles on which any new plan might be based
3. Proposals that people could rally around
4. Communication of this plan 
5. An opportunity
6. People ready to take advantage of this opportunity when it does arise.

How do we create that narrative? Well, this book is a contribution to it. It is very important to build a narrative that works for everyone in society and caters to the different ways that people live in the world and contribute to their economic lives.

The first principle of the Beveridge report was that 'revolutionary times need revolutions not patching'. We do not at present have the luxury of a fresh start. But we are starting to live in revolutionary times. Tax and welfare justice and simplification and their benefits in tackling great challenges facing us are, we suggest, good places to start. This book aims to provide some policies to help escape from a possible hell of environmental destruction and inequality. It gives us the means to complete Smith's goal of widely shared prosperity in a beautiful and secure planetary home. And it shows that our responsibility to our nation and our planet is not only personal but also political. We seek a Tax Heaven to preserve what we have, and to ensure a more heavenly future. Our quest is to search for tax heaven, that is a tax and social security system that is beneficial, practical and fair.  In order to achieve that, In order to predict the effects of the tax system, we will need to expostulate a theory of how the economy works. We will need to define in turn the benefits as well as the costs that could come from a tax system. We will need to work the a system that is practical, and just.  In order to actually change the tax system, we will need to develop a theory of how political change might happen. Finally we will need to work out how realistically how we can get from where we are today to where we wish to be.**

We must reclaim our minds and awaken to the story we have been told about how the economy works. We must see the evidence of the consequences, and realise that there are alternatives. We must start to tell a new story. 

## Previous Frameworks and Guidelines for Successful Reform

According to Bird and Oldman [-@BirdAndOldman] there are eleven main aspects that need to be considered for a successful tax reform. In this section we take Bird and Oldman's categories, and specify them for this particular book, in the order that they are covered in this book:

## **Feasibility of proposals**

Malcolm Torry in his recent book 'The feasibility of citizen's income' [@Torry2016], considers desirability of an unconditional per capita payment to all citizens and then distinguishes between, and analyses, seven different types of 'feasibility':

1. Fiscal
2. Household financial
3. Psychological
4. Administrative
5. Behavioural
6. Political
7. Policy process
   We cover these notions of feasibility in our evaluation of these proposals in part 14.
