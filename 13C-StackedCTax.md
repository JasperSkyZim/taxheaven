# Stacked Carbon Pricing: 

Stacked Carbon Pricing Is A Method of Charging for Carbon at the Border for High Carbon Intensity Goods. It also allows prioritisation of high-importance Carbon taxation. Most of all it is norm-based, it allows the separation of the tax paid from the incentive effect.

A layered carbon tax is a way of implementing a carbon tax that maximises the incentives to reduce emissions whilst minimising the political and economic barriers to a carbon tax’s imposition. It does this by layering, and prioritisation.

It achieves this through a layered norm based approach. Each layer is revenue neutral and combines a tax on carbon intensive inputs with a subsidy on the outputs of that layer.

The production subsidy on the output of a layer is cancelled out in most cases by an equal and opposite tax on the consumption of that good in the next stage of the energy food chain.

So for example there might be a tax on fossil fuel inputs to electricity generation. Those taxes are used to fund a per kWh subsidy on electricity production. In stage 2, the consumption of electricity would then be taxed in exactly the same way .

Note therefore that at each stage there is the possibility of production that is not consumed within the country (exports) and consumption that is not produced within the country (imports). Note also how naturally these are dealt with by the tax system.

Production that is not consumed in the home country would be given a carbon tax combined with a per unit subsidy. Thus production at the average carbon intensity would face no net taxes, whereas production more dirty than average would face net taxes and production cleaner than average would face net subsidies.

In order to transform the effects of a carbon tax on the economy, we introduce a high level of incentive. Even a low level carbon tax has positive effects. The UK introduced a carbon tax, known as a carbon price floor in X. It eliminated coal power from the uk gwneation mix. Carbon tsaxated work. nut xcan we do better? Perhaps they can. The issue is: how high can your carbon tax be? So normally we say that a high carbon tax is politically difficult or economically challenging. I want to suggest a couple of ways in which it doesn't have to be so.

The first way is through output subsidies and the second is historical norms. You can move from one to the other. Output subsidise can be layered: the tax on one layer can be a tax on the next layer. Why have it at all, since it's cancels. Well firstly prioritisation and secondly imports and exports: it provides a useful way to deal with imports and exports of high embodied carbon goods.
