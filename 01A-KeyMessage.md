# PART 1A: THE MESSAGE OF THIS BOOK
# Key Message

This book is about the economic conditions for widely-spread and sustainable prosperity. Why, given great technological and economic progress, do we still have problems? Why, amidst so much wealth, are our lives so economically precarious? If in the 1960s, it took an average person in the UK on average wages four years wages to buy their own home, why now does it take an average person on average wages ten years buy the same home -- if, that is, they have anything left over to save up after paying their current landlord? If we have all the technology to solve our environmental problems -- climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing for example -- then why are we not solving these problems? If we can find the root cause, then we will perhaps be able to find a remedy.  

The 19th century writer Henry George’s book *Progress and Poverty* also asked a similar question. Why, given technological progress, did we still have so much poverty? He argued  that it was the private ownership of land that caused poverty. And that problem still arises today. It's the location of houses that gives them their value. the reason we cannot easily buy a good home, is that the land underneath the home is privately owned and highly valuable. George argued to tax land value and to eliminate other taxes. 

Today we face the same problem, but also environmental destruction. We have a market economy, in most of the world, with competition, growth and technological progress. But we still have economic precariousness and environmental pollution, despite having the wealth and technological ability to prevent them. Our economic system is not allowing us to take full advantage of the progress that we make. So why do we have these problems of pollution and precariousness? We identify three phenomena described by the great economists. 

We call the first notion 'economic theft'. Economic theft (negative externalities) is when one person or company’s behaviour damages another person or the environment where the first person does not pay for it. So for example, if I throw my plastic waste into the ocean, it can then damage fish and other marine life. My careless action has stolen from the future of the ocean. 

We call the second notion spillover benefit. In this case, my actions create benefits for someone else or for the natural environment but I am not paid for it. 

We call the third notion generalised rent. Imagine I am a landlord. Once I own some land with property on it, I can simply sit back and enjoy the flow of income, without having to work. This flow of income is called rent. Rent goes up, as wages increase. Similarly, if I own a big monopoly with no competition, I can also own a permanent flow of profits that competition will not touch. We term these two forms of property income 'generalised rent'. Generalised rent is a permanent flow of income associated with an asset that cannot be replicated. 

The result of these three economic effects is that we have too much pollution, not enough genuine wealth and economic growth that benefits the rich unfairly. In some countries, economic growth may even stop. For the planet as a whole, this model is catastrophic. This book shows a route out of this economic situation.

Economists have been aware of these effects for some time. Yet, taxes which would correct these economic distortions have only been imposed occasionally and partially. Why haven’t corrective taxes been imposed? The common answer is that taxes on rent and economic theft (negative externalities) threaten powerful interests. This view has some merit. However, there is another problem. Nobody has made a sufficiently passionate and positive case for these taxes. This book aims to correct that. 

Economists should work out ways to impose the economic effect of such taxes whilst minimising the resistance to them. Resistance to taxes is associated with concentrated losses on specific groups. These groups can easily mobilise to resist new taxes. So taxes, which could change the nature of these agents (for example, converting an oil company to a renewables producer) cannot be imposed because the very same agents resist the taxes as they oppose their interests. But these interests would change if the nature of the company was to change from oil to renewables. So we a have catch-22 situation. We can't change the companies without the tax. But we can't impose the tax without changing the company, since they resist politically. Instead, we need forms of tax that don't face such resistance but which lead to the transformation of companies in a positive direction. 

In this book, we suggest a simple model. Rather than impose a blunt tax which directly charges for generalised rent or economic theft, we should recognise that the agents engaging in rent extraction or pollution have done so because of a societal norm. The role of taxes should be to *both* recognise the validity of their prior behaviour -- given that norm -- and to encourage the change to a new norm. This is what we call a norm and incentive based taxation system. To put in more concrete terms, we need to give individuals and companies strong incentives to change behaviour whilst not directly threatening their financial interests. The tax gives the relevant company an incentive to change the nature of the company but does not directly threaten its interests. 

Applying this model to greenhouse gas taxation gives us a feebate. A feebate would charge electricity producers for their fossil fuel inputs and would subsidise them for their production of electricity per kilowatt hour (kWh) produced. We suggest taxes on wealth based on assets and on notions of transitional justice. In other words, we should tax assets in a way that cannot be avoided, but we also should impose the tax with consideration to justice both of the system created and of the transition from the existing system to the new. In practical terms, this means taxing land values but recognising that the value paid for that land originally was earned justly.


## Economic Thought

Economics is the study of activities that are, at least in part, motivated by financial gain or that involves resources that are inherently scarce. Economics used to be called *political economy*. This term comes from Ancient Greek. Political in an older sense means ‘in relation to the *polis*’. *Polis* in turn means the city-state, the name for the political organisation in ancient Greece. Economy comes from two Greek words *Oikos*, meaning household, and *Nomos* meaning law. Therefore, *Oikonomos* means household management and, in English, the term *political economy* comes from the notion of household management of the state.

Classical political economy -- the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx -- was written in prose. Modern economics is often written in maths! Classical political economy dealt with the economy as a dynamic process and did not shy away from grand statements about divisive topics such as how the economy distributed its gains. Thus, the works of political economy by the great authors always had questions of taxation at their heart. What is an efficient and fair taxation system given what we know about the principles of political economy? Thus at the heart of political economy has always been the question of just distribution and of taxation as a means to remedy the situation. 

This makes political economy -- and now economics -- powerful. Also, it means that economics has implications for the financial interests of everyone. One can believe an economic theory for scientific reasons, but one might also support some theory because it furthers one's own interests. This makes political and economic discourse somewhat fraught. It also means that there is a suspicion that the corrupting power of self-interest may affect the balance of those economic theories that are thought authoritative. In this book, we aim to reconcile classical, neoclassical, Keynesian and modern system dynamic economic thinking to give a more authoritative approach.   

In our chapter on economics, we define some classical economic problems. How are prices determined? How does the economy distribute the gains from economic progress? Does self-interest and the free market provide a desirable outcome?

These questions are related not only to economic processes -- for example, production and competition -- but also to taxation and the structure of private property. What assets can be owned? And, who in fact owns the assets? And how much tax should they pay for owning  assets or for engaging in economic activity? Desirable economic outcomes depend not only on economic activity but also on the taxation system and the system of property rights.

Adam Smith, in his famous work *The Wealth of Nations*, set out an economic model of how economic growth could lead to widely-spread prosperity. He argued that the division of labour leads to higher levels of productivity. 

If an entrepreneur makes an improvement in production processes, he can lower his cost of production and still sell at the price of his competitors. In other words, he can make a profit. In the short term, therefore, the advantages of his improvement accrue to him. Thus, the profit motive provides an incentive to make improvements. 

However, his competitors may notice the improvement that he has made and replicate it. In order to capture market share, they will lower their prices towards the new cost of production. There might be a price war to capture customers. After the competition has taken its course, we will be left with a different situation. The price of the good concerned will have fallen to just above the new production cost. Therefore, the new beneficiary of the technological improvement would be everyone who purchases the product. Technological progress, the profit motive and competition would lead to widely-spread prosperity. 

This model relies on certain assumptions. A production process, once improved, can be replicated. There must be enough market participants for competition to work. If there is only a single monopolist, or if entrance to the market is very expensive, then competition will not work as described. Instead, the beneficiary of economic activity and improvement of technological processes will be the owners of the single monopolist or the incumbent firm. 

Similarly, if the process relies on some factor of production that cannot be replicated, for example, land, then the beneficiary of the economic progress will be the landlords. 

Usually, damaging other people or their interests (for example, through injury or theft) is illegal. But some economic activities which damage others are still legal. Driving a car, which pollutes the environment and could harm pedestrians if there is an accident, is legal and normal, but nevertheless, damaging to others' interests. Small, indirect damages from many independent sources can add up to a lot in total. 

What seems acceptable when societies are small may nevertheless be unacceptable when societies are larger. For example, Newfoundland fishermen could fish without constraints when their boats were small and their numbers low. There were plenty of fish. However, fish stocks are not unlimited. There is a limit on how many fish can be taken before it damages the fishery. If too many fish are taken, then the fish don’t get a chance to reproduce, and the fish stocks collapse. This is what happened in Newfoundland. Fish used to be so plentiful that the sea teemed with life. But after the collapse in the fish stock, many fishermen went out of business.       

Economics needs to account for these external damage. Taxation should also correct the market, so those who damage the environment pay for the damage that they cause.

## Taxation Thought

One key challenge to taxation is working out a means of taxation that can tax wealth and flows of income across international boundaries. Generally, the issue is as follows: One cannot tax big companies or rich individuals because they will simply move their money abroad. Furthermore, we might even wish to reduce our taxes on companies in order to encourage them to locate in our country. This is problematic because it tends to lead to companies paying less and less tax. 

Such a challenge also applies to the taxation of fossil fuels. If we tax emissions that are produced in the UK, this might encourage UK-based producers to relocate outside the UK. If instead, consumption of carbon-intensive goods is taxed, imports of goods produced abroad would be in scope, but exports would not. This would be helpful for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would give a true picture of the emissions that a country is responsible for due to its consumption behaviour. Secondly, it creates a true incentive for exporting countries to decarbonise their economy. Thirdly, it encourages production processes to be improved, rather than simply relocated abroad. 

Taxation of wealth also faces similar issues. Taxation theory aims to identify a base of taxation that is unresponsive to the tax. So in taxing wealth, we could argue for taxation of assets rather than taxation of wealthy individuals. Land is a straightforward asset to tax in this way. Land cannot just move out of the country. 

Taxing corporate wealth is more difficult because a corporation is a more fluid and mobile than land. In this book, we suggest two radical strategies. 

The first approach is the taxation of profits calculated as UK sales minus UK costs. This approach encourages companies to locate their costs in the UK. The higher the tax rate, the more operations would be moved to a UK base. 

The second approach is an apportionment of multinational wealth based on where the sales of the companies are located. 

Thus both for environmental damage and for wealth, we use consumption as a relatively fixed tax base.       

# Scope

Are you looking for a new economic model for your country? This book is addressed to economists, scientists, politicians, businesspeople, other professionals, and interested members of the general public.

This book is concerned with how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent', and international flows of money and assets. Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without effective governance systems to constrain them. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies. We argue that generalised rent leads to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich. International tax avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep. 

## Tools In Scope
The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems. The book proposes a simple and effective tax and social security system to solve these problems and to enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet.

We are interested in two other systems in particular that overlap with the tax system: the financial and monetary system and the social security (welfare) system. Our focus is the UK tax and welfare system, but the ideas are intended to be applicable to most societies around the world. Out of scope is the detail of the benefits system and the detailed technicalities of how some taxes work. We focus on the big picture rather than accounting of taxes, although we do cover some implementation choices.

## Systems in Scope
We are interested in an economy that is fit for our children. This means that we need the *private sector* to have the right incentives. So there are two, distinct, systems that are in scope of our book. The first is, in a sense, the entire private sector. If the private sector does not have the right incentives, it will not produce the right outcomes. The second system is more technocratic: the taxation system itself. And how can we actually change these systems?

# Recapitulation 
## An Economy Fit for Our Children

There has been tremendous technological progress and economic growth. But we still have problems. We have economic insecurity and pollution. 

What would an economy fit for our children look like? I think it would have two important aspects. Firstly, the beautiful things that require care, like the natural environment, would be preserved. Second, the limited things would be rationed by taxes rather than by private property, so that everyday people have a stake in the common resources and land doesn't become so expensive that individuals cannot afford their own homes.

This book is about economics for a certain type of world. In this world, there are some goods that can be added to, either in quantity or quality; there are some goods that are fundamentally fixed; and there are some goods that can be degraded or destroyed. By 'goods' I mean broadly useful natural or artificial things. These positive, limited or negative things can apply to both public and private goods. We need an economics that not only considers the parts of the economy that are additive (growth economics) but also those that are fixed (distribution economics) and those that are 'subtract-able' (environmental economics).

Environmental economists also distinguish between goods that are *excludible* and non-excludible. And also those that are *rival* versus non-rival. Related to rival-ness is *subtract-ability*. So pure public goods are non-rival and non-excludable. Club goods (for example, watching a pay-per-view sports match) are non-rival (it doesn't cost anything for someone extra to watch it) but excludible. Common pool resources are rival but non-excludible. They are also subtract-able. [VERY CONFUSING, EXPAND AND REWRITE]


## Economics, Opportunity and Hope

This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich or poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well-informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super-rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore, it is a book about economics. If the private sector is not to harm our general well being, then an effective tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system would tax bad things, not good things. And it taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The physical use of natural resources should be taxed, and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus, we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with benefits, training, finance, energy and housing. In short, our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus, leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having a new purpose.


## A Theory of Change

How do we change the tax system? We need to maximise the effect whilst minimising the resistance to change. It's this sort of system that can maximise the good that can be achieved. This is true in two areas in particular: in environmental/energy policy and in housing policy. If you want to have a big effect, you need a big incentive. But big incentives have losers and, therefore, suffer political resistance. In other words, we use financial incentives to promote wider forms of entrepreneurship for public benefit.

What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, beneficial and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately.
