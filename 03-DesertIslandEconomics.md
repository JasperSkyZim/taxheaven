# PART 3: DESERT ISLAND POLITICAL ECONOMY

The purpose of this section is to take you on a whirlwind tour of some important ideas in economics and the history of economic ideas. We shall introduce these ideas through stories on a set of islands, which we will call The Economic Archipelago (the 'Tea Islands'). (In the subsequent chapter we will introduce these same ideas more formally using a different analogy: the cake.)

## 3.1 Growth on Great Island: Adam Smith's Model

The largest island in the Tea Islands is called 'Great Island'. On Great Island live a few hundred people. Everyone does the same thing, a bit of everything. Half the day is spent fishing (including maintenance of the boats and nets) and half the day is spent gathering nuts and berries. This yields 250g of fish and 250g of nuts and berries. In total, 0.5kg of food which is equal to their dietary needs. In this economic fable we will demonstrate Adam Smith's model of growth through specialisation.

**Specialization and Trade**

Then a small group of fishermen discover something. They decide firstly, that they are *only* going to fish, and not worry about gathering berries. Whilst they enjoy nuts and berries, they argue that they can catch enough fish and *trade* some of the fish they gather for nuts and berries. They also split up tasks between themselves. Some of them make nets, others build bigger boats. They can catch more fish by splitting up tasks in this way. By collaborating and specializing they can double their productivity. Where before they could only make 500g of food per day, now they, collectively, can produce 1kg of food per day. 

They now have choices. The first option is to work all day (8 hours) and sell the surplus, either saving the excess or spending it on some luxuries. The second option is to cut down working hours by working only 4 hours per day. In the shorter working day they can still produce enough food to live on. In both cases the fishermen in the firm have higher hourly wages than before - twice what they were making before. These higher wages reflect the higher productivity. 

So the improvement was generated by the fishermen and their initiative, and they are the beneficiaries of the new ways of working. The economy has grown, but at present the new prosperity has gone entirely to the fisherman that initiated the improved ways of working. The price of fish relative to berries is unchanged. One kg of fish still sells for one kg of berries.

## Competition

So at first, the benefit of improvements are captured by those that made the improvement. They get to live a life of luxury. And everyone else is pretty much as before, except that they notice the specialised-fishermen getting richer and richer. 

Soon some other folks notice what the fisherman have done and give it a try. And then some more fishermen pile in. Fortunately the seas are plentiful. Once each has replicated the new improved double-productivity setup, they can each sell fish. But something strange happens. Given the people only want to buy a certain quantity of fish, the fishermen undercut each other in order to win market share. The price of fish in terms of berries starts to fall. 

## The Labour Theory of Value

To what price should the price of fish fall to? It continues to fall until the point at which, in the new circumstances, it only just makes sense for workers to go fishing in the new fishing-conglomerates. In short when the wages from fishing in the new improved setup equilibrate to the wages just going gathering. In other words, the price of fish relative to berries will fall until it makes the same sense for someone to fish as to go collecting berries. This assumes of course that there is some value in eating some berries, perhaps for a varied diet. 

So now, the cost of fishing is expected to fall. In the new circumstance perhaps, 1kg of fish (taking one day to collect) buys 0.5kg of berries (also taking one day to collet). Given the new cheaper price of fish relative to berries.

## Widely Shared Prosperity?

So at the end, people fish for a day to get 1kg of fish and perhaps go collecting for a day for 0.5 kg of berries. 2/3 of the people fish, and 1/3 of the people collect berries (a change from half-half before the imrpovement in capabilities.) The total average food production is 2/3+1/6=5/6 or about 0.82kg. Thus the real wages per day have increased as 0.5kg per 8=hour day to 0.82kg of food per 8 hour day.

This is shall we say the basic model of division of labour and competition. Let's now extend this model to the situation where there is scarce land which is privately owned.

## 3.2 Rent on Private Property Island

Our fisherman is considering a change of direction. He has heard that there are two new islands, only recently discovered, which sounds like a paradise. Rabbits run free and are easy to hunt. Fishing is rather laborious whereas hunting rabbits sounds much easier. Our fisherman sets out to visit the first island. The first island is one of private property.

On this island, there is a man, lets call him 'Man Friday' living on it. He is well abrest of the laws of property. He defines himself the owner of the property. He arms himself to make sure that nobody else can take any of the property. He prepares to charge rent to anyone who turns up. Thus we will call this island 'private land island'.

Then a new man turns up, we can call him Robinson Crusoe. This man has been used to living at sea in a fishing boat. Every day he fishes, he catches 1kg of fish, which, we can assume are very nutritious. 

Crusoe arrives at the island which is full of rabits which are easy to hunt. If he is to work a whole 8-hour day, he can now catch 8kg of rabbits. Let's say that a rabbit is just as nutritious as a fish, and the work is just as pleasant. In fact, he only needs 1kg of food to live on, so he can work one hour per day and relax reading books the rest of the time.

After the second day of fruitful hunting, Man Friday turns up to say hello. Fortunately through a twist of fate, they all speak the same language. Friday is very happy that Crusoe has turned up. He invites Crusoe round to dinner. It's a very beautiful dinner: rabbit en croute. Friday has many beautiful items on the wall, won from many years of selling rabbits to passing tradespeople. He even has a beautiful gun and half way through the meal, he gets it out of the gun holster to show Crusoe, places it on the table to show him, and then puts it back in its holster.

Dessert is served. Friday has a family of servants who help him. Friday is saying how he is glad that crusoe has joined the island. Half way through the desert, Friday gets to the point. "Oh about the rent" he says. "Would seven per day be ok?"

In a moment, the pleasant world of Crusoe disappears. He had not even considered that Friday would charge him rent. There was space enough on the island for all. But Crusoe had few options. The best profession he had found up to now, a fisherman, earned 1 kg of food for a full days work. Living on dry land seemed attractive (at least he was not subject to the storms). He had thought that he could work only one hour per day. But now he realised that his working hours would not change. The eight hour shift of fishing to get one unit of fish is the same as the eight hours he would have to work to get eight kg of food in the new situation, of which seven would go to his landlord! He would still work the same hours, and get the same pay. Admittedly the new situation was a little better as he was not subject to the storms and salt-corrosion of his boat, but it was not the bliss that he previously envisioned.

It's interesting to note that the net wage after rent of our new arrival depends actually not on the conditions of the island, but rather on the conditions in his next best option, which is to go fishing. Suppose that fishing made 2kg of fish per 8 hour day (0.25 kg per hour). The landlord, observing this, would need to charge only 6kg of rabbit per day in rent, since Robinson Crusoe could always do better fishing otherwise. This is odd and worth repeating: the well being of someone here depends on the options that they have available elsewhere.

Thus we could see perhaps that the abolition of traditional peasant rights in England during the enclosure acts could be the fundamental cause of poverty in big cities thereafter. Without the option to be a peasant, there was no options for workers to earn any sort of wage. Therefore the wages paid by industrial capitalists need be enough to keep them alive, but no more - subsistence wages.

The landlord can extract *rent* constituting the surplus over wages (in this case the net resoirces kept by Robinson once he has paid his rent).

**Differential Rent**

Imagine the island is split in two, one half is owned, the other is not. On one side of the island, rabbits are plentiful, and 8kg of rabbits per day can be hunted. On the other side, rabbits are less plentiful and only 4kg per day can be hunted. The landlord rents out both plots, but the rent charged on each can differ. Assuming for now that the wage that an unemployed person can make is still 1kg per day when fishing. Thus the landlord can charge 3kg of rabbits for residence on the less productive plot and still 7kg of rabbits per day for residence on the more productive plot.

**Absolute Rent**

Let's say that for some reason there's a series of storms the people on the islands find it hard to catch fish. The landlords however have some spare resource - stored dried food - that they have accumulated over many years. They sell this food to the fishermen. In exchange the fishermen sell their boats to the landlords and rent them back. Now there is no rent-free way of earning a living. In this situation, land and other ways of earning a living are absolutely scarce. They have been bought up by the wealthy landlords.

We can consider two possibilities: the first is that there is a shortage of workers. In this case, there will be some level of scarcity in labour and therefore wages will be kept up. The split between the revenue going to the landlords for renting a boat and labour will depend on the 

Now of the 1kg of fish, only half a kg is retained, the other half is paid as rent for the boats. The residual wages are not now set at what the fishermen can earn in a rent-free existence, but rather the minimum that will keep them alive.

**Capital**

Let's say that Robinson sets aside some of his wages not to live but to invest for the future. He works for a bit and then creates some rabbit traps. He has to invest his time in the traps but after making the traps, his productivity is doubled from 1 rabbit per hour to two; or from 8 rabbits per day to 16. 

It takes him one day to build the traps. The traps double his daily productivity to 16 rabbits per day: it increases his productivity by 8 rabbits. And the traps, when in use  themselves last 10 working days (80 hours) before they have to be completely replaced. 

Does this investment make sense? Let's work it out. Basically there's an investment of 8 hours of time, and this leads to 8 extra rabits per day for 10 days, in other words 80 extra rabbits. I give up 8 rabbits in the day to construct my trap, and I get back 80 rabbits. Let's say that I borrow the resources to make the traps, so I borrow 8 rabbits to pay the rent and feed myself the day I make the traps.

Thus my profit is 72 rabbits (assuming I continue to work a full day) per 10 day cycle, just over 7 rabbits profit per day, once the cost of my investment is taken into account.

At last Robinson Crusoe is happy! He is a great believer in hard work. He is working full days to pay the rent. He will continue to work full days. He can invest his time and create the traps and then after having paid back the time invested, there will be a surplus too! He can sell the spare rabbits to passing trades people or to Man Friday. And he can build up assets.

We are assuming that Crusoe has some financial buffer, some wealth to tide him over for the day that he is building his trap and therefore not hunting. If rent is payable daily, he  might be able to delay paying rent, he might be able to borrow some rabbits or other resources to pay rent, or he might invest his own stock of wealth until the investment pays back. 

So everything is going swimmingly well, he invests the time and he makes a surplus and soon enough he's selling the spare rabbits to passing trades people and building up a store of value. 

But there's a catch. Friday comes round, observes what is going on. He takes some photos. And soon enough some adverts go up in the Archipelago Gazette, the local newspaper for the islands. It's only with a passing ship that Crusoe sees them. The adverts say the following: make a fortune hunting rabbits! Earn 16 rabbits per day. He also reads the small print: requires 8 rabbits investment to make traps. Rent: 14 rabbits per day.

14 Rabbits! He's only paying 7 at the moment! What's coming? Sure enough there are some visitors at the island and they come around, friendly enough. The next day Man Friday invites Crusoe round for dinner again.... "About the rent"... he says. "I know you are enjoying staying here". He continues. " But the market is changing. Market rents are going up. I had an offer the other day for someone to pay double what you are paying. Of course, I prefer to go with you so I won't chuck you out as long as you pay what the market is saying. It's only 16 rabbits per day. You still make a healthy 2 rabbits profit (actually one after paying for your investments but let's skip that).

Note that it seems that *property* is the fundamental problem here. That is true. But as we will see, abolishing property causes its own problems....

## 3.3 Overhunting on Open Access Island

Let's now imagine another island. On this island there is no property rights. Anyone can hunt for rabbits anywhere. And like the island just mentioned, there is no landowner! Everyone comes to the island. 

In the beginning, everyone was happy. Wages, 8 rabbits per day, or one per hour, made everyone happy. The problem this time was that too many people came. Since land was not owned by anyone, everyone hunted the rabbits, and in the end too many rabbits were taken from the natural environment. 

Because everyone cared for themselves and not for other people many more people came to the island. And those people started to deplete the common pool of rabbits on which everyone relied.

One person hunting for rabbits depletes the stock of rabbits that everyone relies on.  There is an ecological collapse. Soon there are many fewer rabbits left. People start to have less food to eat. Those that can, leave.

Whereas on the island with private property, people are poor, but there's no mismanagement. People do work too hard however!

## 3.4 Inequality on Special Island

Let's say now that hunters vary significantly in their skill level. There's still a limited quantity of land, and a limited quantity of rabbits. It's just that some people are much better than others. If there had been unlimited rabbits or unlimited land, this doesn't seem to be much of a problem. But if there's limitations it seems to be more of an issue. The successful hunters increase the price of land, and they also pressure the rabbit population squeezing out more of the rabbits for themselves so there are fewer for others. The taxes we imposed do help a bit. They mean hunters need to get rich by hunting ability rather than by merely owning land. But in a limited environment, the good hunters don't just benefit from their own hunting, they also impact on the others. They raise the marginal price of land, and so make it more difficult for large families. And they hunt rabbits so that there is less to go around for the others. This justifies what we call progressive taxation.  Progressive taxation means taxing people that make more, more heavily.

## 3.5 Economic Justice on Dream Island

What good are we aiming at? One of the islands on our archipelago is an island of our dreams. The fruit is bountiful, the water is clean, the people are happy. Everyone has a house or can build one with their own money. Fisheries and forests are managed well. Some people are richer than others, but the difference isn't huge, and the people are rich or high status are those that have contributed the most to society. The community collaborates to ensure that the political system is not corrupt and governs the society well, the citizens trade with other islands and each other. There is work for all, but no-one has to work very long hours. The financial system supports beneficial activities, for example clean power and a recharging system for electric cars. Financially, people are secure with investments in the local factory, which, whilst its mostly robotised, provides everyone with a dividend to spend on the products that it and other factories produce.

What has this fantasy island got to do with our life here and now, and in particular our taxation system? Tax, we claim, can encourage the private sector towards this heavenly state. And it is not only tax and the social security system which we propose to reform, but also some elements of the financial, education and pensions systems. We do not however consider these systems in full: that we must leave to others to consider.

Now what can we say about tax on this island? Well, in simple terms, tax is fair and fairly simple and straightforward for everyone to understand. But the tax system in important ways, supports the rest of the economy, not only in how the revenue can be spent but also in the ways that the tax system creates the incentives for the economy to function correctly. The two main ways that the taxation system can be used are generally *redistributive* and *environmental taxes*.  We will get to our dream island again but let's go back to the other islands in our archipelago.

**Getting to Dream Island**

Let's now work out our solutions to the problems that we have encountered. It's easiest to solve the problems before they get started: to set things up right from the start.

The first solution is a land value tax: a tax on rent. The landlord is taxed according to the surplus of each piece of land. He makes no money. There's no such thing as the landlord any more, really. Land becomes free to buy but the person that occupies it has to pay rent to the central authority.

What does the central authority do with the rabbits? There's two options: firstly the government could provide public services. Secondly, they could give the rabbits back to everyone, per person.

What about over-hunting? Well if rabbit hunting is a concern then a limited number of permits could be issued. Hunting rabbits could be constrained. Or put another way, a tax could be levied on hunting rabbits. 

On the propertied land, If the rabbits don't run freely between then it can be expected that the landowners/renters will themselves look after the rabbits on their own plots. Therefore a land value tax plus property solution with the taxes paying for service.

Alternatively, if the rabbits do run freely between plots, there will need to be a solution that constrains hunting.

## 3.6 Appendix: Further Issues

- Monopoly (could add to example earlier)
- Urban Land and Urban Land Rent

## Appendix to chapter 3. THE ECONOMIC CAKE (Late draft)

In the last chapter we introduced an archipelago of islands and showed the different economic issues that come about. In this section we formalise these arguments in another way, in relation to the analogy of making a cake.

To illustrate clearly the issues that our society faces, we often use the analogy of the economy as a cake. 

We can generally classify the big economic problems into six main groups:

1. How big is the cake? The questions of *growth*.
2. How big a slice of the cake does each economic actor get? The problem of *distribution* of income and wealth between classes and individuals.
3. From what is the cake made? The problem of *allocation* of real resources to make the economic cake.
4. Does the cake as a whole rise to its full potential? -- The problem of achieving full employment and sufficient *demand*.
5. How much can we charge for our cake slices? The *price of goods*.
6. How much is the cake shop worth? The *price of assets*.

Tax policy intersects all six of these issues. We want to design tax and welfare policy that leads to a successful economy in the long and in the short term, that allocates resources appropriately, and that leads to a just and appropriate distribution of income.

## A3-1 Growth: How big is the cake?

Growth is the problem of 'how big' the economy is, how much wealth and prosperity there is. First we have to define the problem. What should we measure? Francois Quesnay defined the 'tableau economique' which was the originator of the modern concept of Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. We will stick to real income as a measure of economic success, following Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations, perhaps the first systematic approach to working out what makes the economic pie bigger. Whilst Smith's perspective (and that of growth theory generally) is about increasing the income of an economy, we might also consider the question of the stock of wealth in an economy. By wealth in this context, we don't just mean financial claims, but rather the wealth of the whole country or world. 

There are, broadly, three proposed solutions to the problem of growth: accumulation, division of labour, and capability more generally.

Growth can be driven by accumulation: more capital; more people (population growth); or more nature ie the extraction of more material energy or other materials from the earth. In each of these cases, we are explaining more 'output' from more 'input'. How much of economic growth can be explained by more input? Solow defined his famous growth model where he considered how much of economic growth could be explained by capital and labour accumulation. His result: accumulation could only explain a small amount of economic growth. He named the residual 'technology'; but in fact this residual consists of a number of factors which we now consider.

Adam Smith made  use of the principle of division of labour in his Wealth of Nations [@smith1776wealth]. By dividing up the manufacture of pins into many steps, each step could be more productive. Smith's competitive approach could be contrasted with earlier Arab economist Ibn Khaldun, considered the division of labour as a way for cooperation to enhance the goods provided in a society  [@Olah2018]. Division of labour makes each step of the production process more efficient, requiring less labour for a given level of output. 

Whilst a 'labour theory of value' cannot explain all the differences in prices between goods, labour is generally the most important element in the prices of goods. As Samuelson, quoted in Blaug [@blaug1997economic] puts it "The operational significance of a one factor model is the importance it gives to technology". Translating this into simple English, as labour is the most important factor, using less of it can raise real incomes. When we divide labour, we increase efficiency. Two people doing separate parts of a more finely divided production process is more efficient than one person doing both tasks. We can also say, therefore, following Smith, that increasing the *size* of a market can also increase wealth, because a larger market, with lower transportation and exchange costs, can divide labour more finely. This is also an argument for free trade.

We can also say that technology is a public good, created by R&D and science. Finally, we should talk about capability more generally. Charles Babbage argued that the economic success of a society was dependent on a 'capability triad': production capabilities, business organisation and economic governance [@Hilton2017]. Therefore success requires a certain amount of activism by government: to promote capability in industry, good management and good governance.

**Implications for the Tax and Welfare System**

What are the implications of all this for taxation policy? Smith himself argued that a good tax system should minimise the discouragement that a tax causes to economic activity.

We can say ourselves the following things:

1. Tax should minimise the barriers to division of labour; and should not discriminate in favour of companies over markets between individuals;
2. Tax should encourage the accumumation of skill and physical capital investment^[this latter point is not uncontroversial given increasing automation, and depends on wide ownership of capital]
3. Tax should encourage the development of capability.

## A3-2 Distribution: How big a slice does each person get?

The final big question that we consider is that of distribution. Distribution typically refers classically to the distribution of the economic cake between those that own land (landowners), those that own companies or other non-land wealth (capitalists) and those that only own their own working time (labour). We covered this in Chapter 1.6, so we will only make a few more comments here.

It is important to distinguish between justified and unjustified Wealth. Justified wealth consists in wealth that is derived from work, the creation of some product of value (or at least wanted) in society - the provision of goods and services. Unjustified wealth consists in effectively extracting the wealth of others. Such wealth is not acquired by the addition of anything valuable to the economy, but rather is gained from endowments or second-hand value creation. 

**Who Really Pays A Tax? Economic Incidence of Tax and Spending**

Another important aspect of distribution is who pays a tax. Taxes are not always paid by those who are the immediate tax payer. In general the theory of incidence suggests that taxes are paid by the most inflexible factor: e.g land, other monopolies.

But public spending also does not always benefit economically the initial recipient. If public services are shared over some area where high quality land is scarce, then it will be the landowner who benefits, not the direct individuals who are tenants. Whilst the advantages of living in an area may go up with better public services, if landlords can charge higher rents in so doing, then the benefit of increased spending may go on increased rent. The Henry George theorem states, that under certain conditions, the beneficiary of all public spending is the landowners. This effect can be seen in practice with a new railway link. In fact, in Hong Kong, new links on the metro are financed by purchase of land near new stations. This provides another justification for taxing the unearned increment on land value.

**Persistent Profit from Companies**

We have already discussed land in some detail. But we should also consider taxing other forms of profit, from companies. Some situations are natural monopolies; others are government created types of monopoly, and finally the dynamics of some production and sales processes naturally favours larger firms.

All situations where an individual or company has some non-replicable advantage can make something similar to rent. Profits can be competed away, rents are permanent. So we sometimes see the phrase 'rent' used in other situations than land, to mean the permanent component of profit. Warren Buffett makes this explicitly: he seeks companies that have a 'moat' to their 'castle', the castle being the profits made and the moat being the barriers to other companies competing away their profit. 

Taxes on profits, especially persistent profits, therefore make a lot of sense. We need to find a way that these profits taxes can't be taxed away.  Finally some firms such as Amazon make a return without making profit at all, by capturing market share they force out the opposition creating a global form of monopoly. So we will need to find a way to tax corporate wealth independent of profit. We cover these these topics in Part 7 on Corporations and in our proposals (Part 12).

## A3-3 Allocation: From What Should the Economic Cake Be Made?

Governments influence the allocation of economic activity two main ways:

- First, governments spend money, therefore directly allocating what is done. They can also lend themselves or direct lending of the financial sector.
- Second, governments create the systems of tax and regulations which guide and directs the private sector.

In both senses, it's important that public goods are taken into account.

Economists often talk of value, by which they usually mean *private value*, which is the benefit generated by someone producing goods and services; and the benefit the consumer receives from buying them. Economists also speak of 'public goods' as those which have various characteristics. The first is that we can't avoid consuming them for better or worse. Also, consuming them does not preclude others from doing so (they are non-exclusive). Some public goods have neither of these characteristics, yet are still provided publicly.

All these reasons provide justification for public goods to be created and shared. Taxation is a way of funding those public goods. However, tax and spending is not the only way of providing public goods. Charities, civic society, individuals and culture can all provide public goods, and the provision of private goods and services as a whole can also be seen as a public good. For example, a locality where there are lots of easily available shops and other services is a kind of public good, because those private goods assist each other in benefiting the people who live there.

**Implications for the Tax and Welfare System**

Creating the right incentives is key to influencing people to behave in a beneficial manner, and the tax system is largely a system of incentives and disincentives. Strangely, the current system incentivises activities we don't want and disincentives activities we do want. To improve people's choices, we have to change these incentives.  We should tax activities that are harmful to others or to the natural environment. This will both reduce/discourage the negative activity and make the actor 'internalise' the harm done by the activities. It will help create a fair playing field for less harmful competitors. There are two types of harmful activity which could be taxed:

- Activities that harm others or the environment: in these cases activities should either be banned (now or in a forward-looking sense) or taxed;
- Activities that harm the individuals themselves such as smoking or excessive sugar and meat consumption: here we need to create a benevolent environment for the individual that does not encourage the harmful activities. This includes having the right incentives especially for the corporate sector (e.g. a sugar tax impacting the composition of breakfast cereals).

## A3-4 Demand: Does the cake rise to its full potential?

Tax and Welfare are important. They are the principal tools by which governments raise revenue to provide public goods and support the poor.  However, taxes must be justified on some basis, if they are to exist at all. The common answer is that tax is needed to pay for common services. 

More generally, taxes are needed because two classes of goods exist in society: private and public. Private goods are those provided by the market economy: i.e. by individuals and companies when acting in a commercial capacity. Public goods are those that benefit us all, like a secure country and public infrastructure. We need taxes to pay for and regulate public goods. The tax system is intended to raise revenue for the provision of public services. 

But this is not the only viewpoint on the primary purpose of taxation. 

**MMT** 

Modern monetary theory (MMT) argues that the purpose of taxation is slightly different. The purpose of taxation according to MMT is to mop up money that is created by public spending. This is an unusual perspective because most people believe that the government needs to tax or borrow money before they can spend it. From the perspective of MMT by contrast, money is simply a collection of tokens acceptable in the payment of taxes and created by public spending in the first place. 

The purpose of taxation within MMT is to control inflation. If more money is issued than there is demand for, the value of that money will degrade relative to the real economy. This means, that even with an MMT perspective, there presumably needs to be some taxation. MMT supporters generally believe that the government can and should run a fiscal deficit but that this deficit is limited by the effect on inflation rather than some requirement for 'austerity' to keep the public debt down. 

So, even proponents of MMT believe we need taxation. But taxation is not the only way to fund the government. There are many options, including fees for govt services, charging rent etc. But the usual options are taxation, issuing bonds, or printing money. On a basic level, we need to tax roughly as much as the government spends. There could be a fiscal deficit, but it should be of a moderate level in normal times.

**Fiscal Deficits**

The MMT perspective is similar to thar of 'functional finance' as described by Abba Lerner. According to this perspective, the purpose of the government deficit is to keep the economy running at full capacity [@Lerner1943]. Government debt will take care care of itself as long as the economy is growing. This is a perspective born out by the post-war experience. (See part 10)

What we are dealing with here is the problem of the correct amount of (effective) demand. Effective demand is really the amount of spending power that agents have in the economy. The government can influence this in two ways: through fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy is the overall budget balance of the government. When governments borrow more than they spend, this increases the budget deficit, which also increases the spending power of those in the economy. 

Monetary policy involves changes to interest rates, which effects asset values. It also effects the exchange rate. In low-interest rate environments, fiscal policy is particularly effective and monetary policy less so ('pushing on a string' in Keynes's vivid phrase).

Thus these two forms of macroeconomic policy (fiscal policy and monetary policy) can both be used to help guide the economy, and solve the short term problem of effective demand i.e., 'how much does the cake rise'.

Our goal here is not to discuss fiscal policy specifically: we assume here that the overall fiscal balance (the difference between spending and taxation) will be determined correctly. Our scope here is the long term matter of *how* to tax, not the short term matter of *how much* to tax.

**Implications for the Tax and Welfare System**

So what are the implications of the macroeconomics of effective demand for tax policy? Firstly, tax policy, in redistributing income and wealth, can increase effective demand and growth. Second, management of the public debt is vital and should be considered in more detail, both from a fiscal perspective and from the point of view of the effects of interest rates on other asset classes (and therefore the interaction with taxes in these areas). In short, low interest rates increase the asset prices in other areas, and that effect can be mitigated by taxes in these areas. So reducing interest rates can be combined with a land value tax and higher taxes on companies.

## A3-5 Selling Cake Slices: The Price of Goods

Modern economics as taught tends to consist at an elementary and intermediate level of the marginalist analysis of Alfred Marshall. (At an advanced level it also includes the more complicated and mathematic treatment of Leon Walras's 'General Equilibrium' analysis. Here we focus on partial equilibrium)

What does this analysis consist of? And what is the relation to classical analysis? Let us consider John Stewart Mill's writing (as mentioned in Mark Blaug's book) because his theory shows that the later classical and neoclassical theory of price determination are equivalent. The classical theory is in some sense just bringing out special cases of the neoclassical theory. But those special cases are important. They are the distinctions that really make a difference.

OK, so let's first describe the neoclassical (Marshallian) theory. he neoclassical theory is very simple to describe: price is set at the intersection between supply and demand. 

As the price goes up, the amount demanded will, in general, fall. It goes down because fewer people are willing to pay.

The supply curve represents the amount of a particular good that will be supplied by firms at different price levels. So as the price of the good increases, it is in general assumed that there will be more firms able and willing to supply the good, and more of that good can be supplied.

**Classical Theory in Neoclassical terms**

The classical theorists also had a theory of price and they focussed mostly on the supply side of the coin. Mill suggests three separate possible outcomes: the first when supply is in inelastic, the second when there's a completely competitive market and finally the last, when there's some diminishing returns, i.e. that the cost of production increases when the amount required increases.

The first case is the easiest. Imagine there is a completely fixed supply of something. For example, there's some plot of land in a desirable location. None of the locations around it are quite the same, and in any case, they are in limited supply also. Since the supply is fixed, the demand for that land is determined by the price that the market is willing to pay, and not by any cost of production (since there is no production: it's fixed in supply)

The second case is also straightforward. Imagine that there is a product that has a fixed cost of production and is made by a large number of competitive producers.

The final case is of diminishing returns. Imagine that there's some good, let's say oil, that is easy to produce in some places (say Saudi Arabia), but hard to produce in others (deep water drilling and oil shale). In the easy places, the cost of production is low, in the hard places the cost of production is high. In this case, the price of the good will be determined by the cost of production of the marginal producer, which is in turn determined by the demand schedule.

So the price of oil is determined by the cost of producing a marginal extra barrel of the market-demanded amount of oil. Of course the market demanded price of oil is itself dependent on price. That's why we intersect the demand and supply curve to see what's the price of oil. [Maybe change the above to grain instead??]

**Implications for Oil**

Imagine we had a closed economy with a single government. The oil market shows the two types of taxes that could be imposed. A land value tax would be a tax on the surplus profit from owning some piece of land when oil is on. It does not shift the point of intersection but rather merely taxes the net profit of producing oil.

Now we mentioned that ownership of land gives rise to a surplus. But what about the value of the land? What would that be? We can consider therefore ownership of land as conferring that surplus. What should the value of that set of surplus flows be?

One method for analysing this is known as discounted cashflow analysis. This computes the value of a set of cashflows according to interest rates seen in the economy. So for example the value of a piece of land that pays £5000 per annum might be computed as 5000/r, where r is the long term interest rate. So for an interest rate of 0.05, the total value would be 5000/0.05 or £100,000. At a lower interest rate of 0.02, the value wold be 250,000.

What about if the value increases in time? Let's say that the rent goes up by 1% per year. In this case, the formula again wold be very simple a/(r-g) where g is the growth rate and r is the long term interest rate

## A3-7 Beyond the Cake: A New Economics

In order to understand why the system is working the way it is, we need to take a look at the the tool-kit used to build it: mainstream neoclassical economics. 

Mainstream economics treats the world as being full of rational people, all looking to best maximise their own personal utility. This utility maximising tendency is the engine behind the flows of demand and supply that interact in efficient markets and influence price levels that then help distribute scarce goods in a  manner. However, people are not always rational, and markets are not always efficient. 

What does that mean for this brand of economics then? Clearly, a lot is missing.

Here we highlight three missing aspects: time, space and life.

## Time

Time is important because much economic activity is about storing value for the future. An example in simple terms would be when an individual stores financial assets (such as money) in a bank and the economic system grows these funds in investment opportunities and ensures that society, as a whole, increases its stock of wealth. That's the theory anyhow. One important factor in economics is ensuring that all this works effectively.

## Space

Space is important for two reasons. Firstly, each square metre of earth's surface is unique. It cannot be replicated. Thus, ownership of such a piece of land represents a monopoly in that it cannot be replicated.  Secondly, we all share in space. This means we all share in generating public goods in the space around us. This includes those created by the public and private sectors. We also share in creating public bads in the space around us, such as pollution.

Time and space interact with real estate. Since land is an infinitely lived monopoly (each piece of earth's surface is unique and lasts forever, for all practical purposes anyway), it has special features in terms of low interest rates. In other words, land is a long-lived asset and it becomes very valuable in low-interest rate environments. This was demonstrated in the follow up to the financial crisis.

## Living Systems

Life is the third class of elements missing in mainstream economic thought. Living systems are fundamentally different from non-living systems. Living systems are typically in a state of homeostasis rather than equilibrium. This is a steady state which requires active maintenance and energy input.  For example,  it takes energy to maintain a constant body temperature of 36.7 Celsius. Biological systems also require certain environmental conditions and cannot exist beyond certain ecological limits. Ecological economics considers that human economy is embedded in nature and it argues for a sustainable economy that would also exist in a steady state ^[This alludes to an ecological / steady state economics approach. See: http://www.steadystate.org/discover/definition/]. So life is not only a crucial element to our planet that we need to preserve, but also a rich set of understandings of the fundamental nature of things. So just like 19th century and 20th century economics often uses analogies from the physical and engineering worlds, we need a new set of understandings based on the nature of life itself.

Human systems develop *capability*, and this capability is embodied in individuals, companies, networks and whole societies. Understanding capability both for private and public ends can allow us to progress further.
