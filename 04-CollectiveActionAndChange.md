# 4A. COLLECTIVE ACTION TOOLKIT

Climate Change has been described as a 'super-wicked' problem. What does this mean? It has characteristics of wickedness plus more.

## Two Traditions in Political Science

In this section we will describe the theory of collective action. there are two major traditions in political science. The rational choice perspective and the cultural perspective. Rational choice sees politics as the interaction between rational agents. Whereas cultural studies sees particular ways of behaving as being enduring, defined by 'culture'. 

The two perspectives are perhaps a dual to one another. For rational choice requires some sort of consistency of preference, interest or behaviour.  And it is this persistence that creates the cultural continuity that is the subject of cultural studies. So onwards, now, with the rational choice approach to collective action.Much of what follows is, I suppose, related to the rational choice literature. But we will also consider the cultural studies tradition.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

The two most famous fables are known as the prisoners dilemma and the tragedy of the commons. The prisoner's dilemma considers two prisoners in a tricky situation. The outcome of the game depends on what the others do. They have two choices to grass up the the co-defendant or to stay quiet. If they both grass, they get a long sentence. But if they cooperate they will get off with a small sentence. However, if one of them cooperates then they will 

## The Tragedy of The Commons

We've already met the tragedy of the commons in our earlier parable on our Tea Island Archipelago. Where access rights are unlimited to a common resource, that resource can be overwhelmed. Say we have a common and everyone has rights to graze on the common. Unless the rights to graze cattle on the common are controlled, it's likely that the common will be overgrazed. Why? Each person sees only the benefit of grazing, whereas the cost in terms of the reduction in the grazing that others can do is shared over everyone else involved. 

## The Logic of Collective Action

The logic of collective action also covers whether groups will act in their collective self interest. Let's say a group of individuals has some collective interest in some matter. Will that group act in its own interest? Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action studies this question. His conclusion was that groups do not always act in their own self interest. Unless they can motivate the members of the group to car about the things that they all have in common then individuals behaving selfishly will not necessarily uphold the interest of the group.

Olson suggests that it is only when the group can coerce its members or when there are members of the group with a *concentrated interest* where action to protect the interest of the group is likely. When everyone has only a weak stake in their collective good then little action is likely.

## Evolutionary Game Theory

The prisoner's dilemma produces different outcomes when repeated. When games are repeated, different strategies can evolve. If an agent has defected in one time period they are less likely to be trusted in the next. Furthermore another playing entity can punish or reward past behaviour. In this context the so called 'tit for tat' strategy is considered a good one. Tit-for-tat punishes a past indiscretion. The 'generous tit-for tat' usually punishes defection, but also occasionally, generously, does not.

## Collective Individualism

A trite oversimplification of the ideological clash of the cold war would be this. On one hand was (*individualism*). Under individualism the *market* determines outcomes and is the interaction of *individual preferences*. (there might be some voting process too, but this is viewed as non-core to the political system). In the collectivist system, the government determines the outcome. In addition there is a certain enforced conformity. New ideas are not welcome.

I want to describe a sort of synthesis. One synthesis is the distributed ownership of collective property such as land. In this we see the ideas of Henry George.

Another is an individual approach to *collective* provision. Consider a community bakery. On one hand this could  be considered a provider of private goods. But on another it's a provider of a sort of public service. the community needs a bakery. It doesn't need two bakeries (unless it is a rather big community). 

So what determines prices? Well in a small community, it's more likely that the community will determine a 'fair price'. The goodwill of the community is important. The community gets together and knows each other. They can decide to go elsewhere or set up a new bakery if the prices are too high or the quality too low.

These two examples show that if there are pervasive and important public goods 



## 'As if' Altruism

Another useful way of thinking was described in the *Social Limits To Growth* by Fred Hirsch. Hirsh's book is famous for the idea of 'positional goods'. Unlike goods that are augmentable, positional goods are those that are essentially fixed. Later in the book, Hirsch describes a decaying moral legacy. He describes 'as if' altruism. As if altruism is a tValue of your vote

We can distinguish between the scarcity of a vote and the scarcity of free time.

## Diminishing Returns

The world is not homogeneous. Imagine plots of land. You have a choice of what plots of land to farm. It makes sense that you would farm the easiest, most productive land first. Thus, as agriculture is expanded, the deployment of additional land suffers diminishing returns. As land area is expanded, the productivity of the new plots is less than those of the existing plots. Diminishing returns are a product that firstly the world has variability and secondly prioritisation. If we take the best plots first, then inevitably the ones left are less good.

Diminishing returns can also be found in a different context. Let's say we can add one factor to a process: for example labour power, but another factor is fixed (for example perhaps there is a limited number of machines).



## Tax Theories of Change

How do we change a system like tax? This book deals with tax reform in two approaches. The first is a 'blank slate' approach. This considers how we would define a tax and welfare system in an ideal world where both efficiency and fairness are achieved easily. 

The second approach takes into account issues of improvement and transition. In other words, what practical politically feasible changes could be made right now to make the system more beneficial and fair?

So what does practicality look like? Often in policy, it is synonymous with political feasibility. Previously, we mentioned the idea of political realism and transitional justice. Changes must not seem both unfair and have obvious losers. Fairness will be often perceived to be a matter of *transition* as opposed to the sort of a perspective we might have when trying to create a tax system from a 'blank state' (as we do within this book). 

The tax system seems to change through top down directives, through the intervention of the chancellor of the exchequer of the time. This approach means that the tax system often changes with the agenda of 'budget day' announcements. Of course,the secrecy around these announcements is to a degree necessary: if agents know how the tax system is going to change, then they may be able to take steps to avoid the taxes. A better approach would be to conduct a strategic tax review, much in a similar way to the strategic defence review.

Any discussion of taxation and welfare needs to consider *political realism*. What is political realism? It's recognising that some policies are politically easier to implement than others. In the context of taxation and welfare, we need to consider *transitional justice* and in particular not make any major groups worse off (except those that had previously benefitted unfairly). So, for example, it might be argued that a 100% land value tax is appropriate in certain locations, but to impose such a tax immediately would be unfair on those people who had recently purchased a house in the last year in a high land value area.

So what would it take to make change happen? I argue here that we need:

1. Political desire for change, a broad public consensus that there is a wrong that needs to be righted.
2. A shared narrative understanding of the principles on which any new plan might be based
3. Proposals that people could rally around
4. Communication of this plan 
5. An opportunity
6. People ready to take advantage of this opportunity when it does arise.

How do we create that narrative? Well, this book is a contribution to it. It is very important to build a narrative that works for everyone in society and caters to the different ways that people live in the world and contribute to their economic lives.

The first principle of the Beveridge report was that 'revolutionary times need revolutions not patching'. We do not at present have the luxury of a fresh start. But we are starting to live in revolutionary times. Tax and welfare justice and simplification and their benefits in tackling great challenges facing us are, we suggest, good places to start. This book aims to provide some policies to help escape from a possible hell of environmental destruction and inequality. It gives us the means to complete Smith's goal of widely shared prosperity in a beautiful and secure planetary home. And it shows that our responsibility to our nation and our planet is not only personal but also political. We seek a Tax Heaven to preserve what we have, and to ensure a more heavenly future. Our quest is to search for tax heaven, that is a tax and social security system that is beneficial, practical and fair.  In order to achieve that, In order to predict the effects of the tax system, we will need to expostulate a theory of how the economy works. We will need to define in turn the benefits as well as the costs that could come from a tax system. We will need to work the a system that is practical, and just.  In order to actually change the tax system, we will need to develop a theory of how political change might happen. Finally we will need to work out how realistically how we can get from where we are today to where we wish to be.**

We must reclaim our minds and awaken to the story we have been told about how the economy works. We must see the evidence of the consequences, and realise that there are alternatives. We must start to tell a new story. 

## Previous Frameworks and Guidelines for Successful Reform

According to Bird and Oldman [-@BirdAndOldman] there are eleven main aspects that need to be considered for a successful tax reform. In this section we take Bird and Oldman's categories, and specify them for this particular book, in the order that they are covered in this book:     

1. *Taxation theory*: Taxing rent and externalities, taking account of the theory of optimal taxation (both its classical formulation and the recent additions).   
2. Macroeconomic situation*: Balance of payments, trade deficit.   
3. *Attractiveness of proposals to politicians and voters*: A reform should be attractive to voters and to specific politician types. There should also be feasible policy pathways to achieving the reform. 
4. *Political realities*: Interest of voter groups, popular notions justice, Interest of powerful groups.
5. *Institutional inertia*: Capture proposals for overcoming this.     
6. *Administrative realities*: Including the existing tax system, making taxes easily calculable, and making the system as automatic as possible.     
7. *Empirical evidence*, for example: effect of incentives at work; Interaction between work, experience, education and salary; effect of environmental taxes on damage; effect of health taxes on health outcomes; effect of taxes on finance.   
8. *Robustness to changing times*: We look at the changing nature of work, and consider the dynamic effects of our tax proposals. 
9. Local knowledge*: Legal nature of tax system; specific problems of UK system tax and economy (regional balances, dysfunctional house prices etc.).      
10. Produce beneficial results: See modelling chapter.

## **Feasibility of proposals**

Malcolm Torry in his recent book 'The feasibility of citizen's income' [@Torry2016], considers desirability of an unconditional per capita payment to all citizens and then distinguishes between, and analyses, seven different types of 'feasibility':

1. Fiscal
2. Household financial
3. Psychological
4. Administrative
5. Behavioural
6. Political
7. Policy process
   We cover these notions of feasibility in our evaluation of these proposals in part 14.
