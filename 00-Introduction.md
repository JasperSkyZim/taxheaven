## About This Book

This book is addressed to those who are looking for a new economic model for rich and poor countries across the world. The intended audience includes economists, scientists, politicians, businesspeople, other professionals and interested members of the general public.

The book is concerned with how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent',  international flows of money and assets. Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without governance systems to constrain them. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies, leading to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich. International tax  avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep. 

## Scope

The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems. The book proposes a simple and effective tax and social security system to solve these problems and to enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet.

We are interested in two other systems in particular that overlap with the tax system: the financial and monetary system, the social security (also known as welfare or 'benefits') system including skills training. The examples given relate to the reform of the UK tax and welfare system, but the ideas herein are intended to be applicable to most societies around the world. Out of scope is the detail of the benefits system and the detailed technicalities of how some taxes  work at the moment. We keep it to the broad scale big picture more than the accounting of taxes, although we do cover some implementation choices.

We are fundamentally interested in an economy that is fit for our children.

## An Economy Fit For Our Children

There has been tremendous technological progress and economic growth. But we still have problems. Those problems can perhaps be described as on one hand economic insecurity and on the other hand damaging our ecological environment. Thus we need an economics that not only considers the parts of the economy that are additive (growth economics), but also those that are fixed (distribution economics) and those that are subtractable (environmental economics).

What would an economy fit for our children look like? I think it would have two important aspects. Firstly the beautiful things that require care, like the natural environment, would be preserved. Second, the limited things would not be 

This book is about economics for a certain type of world. In this world there are some goods that can be added to, either in quantity or quality; there are some goods that are fundamentally fixed; and there some goods that can be degraded or destroyed.By 'goods' I mean broadly useful natural or artificial things. These positive, limited or negative things can apply to both public and private goods. 

Environmental economists distinguish between goods that are *excludible* and those that are *rival*. Related to rivalness is *subtractiblity*. So pure public goods are non-rival and non-excludable. Club goods (for example watching a pay-per-view sports match) are non-rival (it doesn't cost anything for someone extra to watch it) but excludible. Common pool resources are rival but non-excludible. They are also subtractable.


## Economics, Opportunity And Hope

This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich are poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore it is a book about economics. That is not to say that the government can't do good and important things. But if the private sector is not to do bad things for our general well being then the right tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system taxes bad things not good things, and taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The main point is that physical use of natural resources should be taxed; and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes  natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with the benefits and training system, the finance system, the energy system and the housing system. In short our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having new purpose to grow opportunity in our society. We do this through a transformation of the incentives.



## A Theory of Change

The way that we need to set up this tax system needs to maximize the effect whilst minimizing the resistance. It's this sort of system that can maximize the good that can be achieved. In two areas in particular: in environmental/energy policy and in housing policy. If you want to have a big effect you need a big incentive, but big incentives cause big losers and therefore political resistance. In other words we use financial incentives to promote wider forms of entrepreneurship for public benefit.

What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, good and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately. 

## Plan of the Book

This chapter considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasizing where() perhaps!) our ideas are new or innovative. . 

Chapter 1 defines defines a new economic model. It defines the economic objective as preserving and enhancing genuine wealth rather than activity and defines wealth at four levels.

Chapter 2A considers economic reform and economic justice in history, starting with Adam Smith. It introduces the Adam Smith model as a point of departure.

Chapter 2B outlines the principles of the Beveridge report. Like Beveridge, we want to produce a *radical, comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

Chapter 3 build a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the major important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. [To Be Implemented: Empirically we should ask the hypothetical question: *how would the world be different if this or that assumption were true*. We then use quantitative data to see which assumption is appropriate.]

Chapter 4 builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to fairly transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Chapter 5 Considers tax in principle/ It considers the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. *Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing any tax or system of taxation. Each covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions. It defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, good and practical tax system. 

Chapter 6 Considers tax in practice. We look in detail at the margins of tax avoidance.

Chapters 7-12, consider the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality seems to be driven not only by difference in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation.  Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sector, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them. We then apply these ideas to the sectors of the economy.

Chapter 13 -15, contain our proposals and the quantitative modelling work on them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented.  We outline our proposals model them and conclude the book in part 16. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.
