# PART 0. INTRODUCTION
## A Perfect Storm

The film 'A Perfect Storm' describes a true story of a fishing trawler facing a particularly wicked storm. A ship's captain and his fellow New England fishermen had fallen on hard times after poor catches. The captain, played by George Clooney, had assembled a crew and hired a boat to go out for one last fishing trip before the season was out. They sailed out into the mid-Atlantic. After much fruitless searching, they finally struck fish and turned for home, hoping to get the catch back whilst still fresh. 

Unfortunately, a storm was brewing, and not just any storm. Three separate weather systems had merged to create a 'weather bomb'. Meteorologists warned of a serious threat to any fishing boats that braved what would become an epic storm. The fishermen faced the difficult question:  whether to attempt to land their catch whilst still fresh by heading home straight through the storm, or avoid the storm by staying in the mid-Atlantic until the weather system passed and risk the fish being no longer fresh enough to sell once back. Added to this dilemma were communications and leadership difficulties. Communications between the weather forecasters and the boat were interrupted by the degradation of the communications systems. The captain, whilst charismatic, also betrayed hubris and poor judgment.

It is odd, after all, that Clooney and his men felt they needed to take such a severe risk. Why were they in that situation in the first place? Whilst we cannot read other people's minds (let alone the minds of the dead) we can say that there are two main reasons for the original plight of the fishermen which led them to take such extreme risks: environmental damage and economic insecurity. 

First, the seas were no longer as plentiful as they once were. In the past [when?] the Grand Banks off Newfoundland teemed with fish. But overfishing led to a collapse in fish stocks. Similarly, the fishermen whilst having a valuable profession, do not own exclusive rights to fish. 

Second, the fishermen lacked economic security in their lives. They had to fish or go bust. Beyond their own homes, they owned little. Their boats were owned by investors who expected a return and did nothing so dangerous as to actually head out to sea. An absentee landlord, he simply rented out the boat and lived off the surplus. We never meet him, but his presence makes himself felt. The fishermen were economically expendable, a bit like low-value fish that are disposed of the side.

## Turning Spaceship Earth 

What has the perfect storm got to do with the global situation? Quite a lot, perhaps. We on Earth are perhaps facing a similar situation to Clooney's character and his crew. There are warnings of a dangerous climactic and environmental future for the world on the path currently taken. Clever people disagree over whether to take the environmental warning seriously or not: some of us think it's all a hoax, others say it's just natural variability.  We need to decide how to interpret these warnings -- whether to ignore them, like the fateful crew, or to take them seriously. 

But even if we don't ignore the warnings, we have another problem. You and I don't control the direction of the world economy. There is no single captain of spaceship earth. 

Also, we have little idea how the controls of the Spaceship work. And there is little focus on the practicalities of what to do next. This book attempts to use the tax and financial system to change the incentives of the private sector to do the right thing. And it deals with the question of how to make the change.

## About This Book

This book is addressed to those who are looking for a new economic model for rich and poor countries across the world. The intended audience includes economists, scientists, politicians, businesspeople, other professionals, and interested members of the general public.

It is concerned with how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent',  and 'international flows of money and assets'. Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without governance systems to constrain them. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies, leading to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich. International tax avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep. 


## The thesis of the Book (Write this)

- Situation: We have a market economy with competition, growth and technological progress.
- Complication: But we have poverty and pollution.
- Question: How do we fix these issues of poverty and pollution?
- Answer: Carbon Tax and LVT but tailored for a change management political evolutionary landscape.

The core theses of this book are:

1. The cause of environmental destruction is a failure of regulation, specifically the lack of appropriate pricing of environmental damage.
2. The cause of inequality is non-degrading private property in limited things such as land and corporations with market power.
3. The cause of failure to implement appropriate policy is a lack of an appropriate theory of change.

In more detail:

1. Wicked Externalities
   1. There are externalities and they are significant (descriptive point)
   2. If there are external effects, they should be accounted for in the tax system (theoretical point)
   3. Carbon Tax will have the desired effect (functional point)
   4. If we make those tax changes, we should have a certain response (responsive point)
2. Monopoly and Poverty
   1. There are non-productive (monopoly) assets (descriptive point)
   2. If there are monopoly assets, then it's efficient and equitable to tax them (theoretical point)
   3. LVT, cashflow-deductible-investment and corporate wealth tax will have the desired effect (functional point)
   4. If we tax them, then their price will fall; also, wealth will be transferred to productive activities increasing human wealth (responsive point).
3. Theory of Change
   1. Change happens when desire overcomes resistance
   2. Resistance is associated with perceived concentrated financial losses
   3. Instead, minimise losses whilst maximising the effect and associate that with moral statements of real intent (e.g. 'everyone deserves an affordable home', 'every child deserves a nice planet', 'provide opportunities to mobilise the private sector and people to make the changes we need')



## Scope

The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems. The book proposes a simple and effective tax and social security system to solve these problems and to enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet.

We are interested in two other systems in particular that overlap with the tax system: the financial and monetary system, the social security (also known as welfare or 'benefits') system including skills training. The examples given relate to the reform of the UK tax and welfare system, but the ideas herein are intended to be applicable to most societies around the world. Out of scope is the detail of the benefits system and the detailed technicalities of how some taxes work at the moment. We keep it to the broad scale big picture more than the accounting of taxes, although we do cover some implementation choices.

We are fundamentally interested in an economy that is fit for our children.

## An Economy Fit for Our Children

There has been tremendous technological progress and economic growth. But we still have problems. Those problems can perhaps be described as on one hand economic insecurity and on the other hand, damaging our ecological environment. Thus, we need an economics that not only considers the parts of the economy that are additive (growth economics) but also those that are fixed (distribution economics) and those that are subtractable (environmental economics).

What would an economy fit for our children look like? I think it would have two important aspects. Firstly, the beautiful things that require care, like the natural environment, would be preserved. Second, the limited things would not be preserved.

This book is about economics for a certain type of world. In this world, there are some goods that can be added to, either in quantity or quality; there are some goods that are fundamentally fixed; and there are some goods that can be degraded or destroyed. By 'goods' I mean broadly useful natural or artificial things. These positive, limited or negative things can apply to both public and private goods. 

Environmental economists distinguish between goods that are *excludible* and those that are *rival*. Related to rivalness is *subtractability*. So pure public goods are non-rival and non-excludable. Club goods (for example, watching a pay-per-view sports match) are non-rival (it doesn't cost anything for someone extra to watch it) but excludible. Common pool resources are rival but non-excludible. They are also subtractable.


## Economics, Opportunity and Hope

This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich or poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore it is a book about economics. That is not to say that the government can't do good and important things. But if the private sector is not to do bad things for our general well-being, then the right tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system taxes bad things, not good things. And taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The main point is that the physical use of natural resources should be taxed, and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus, we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with the benefits and training system, the finance system, the energy system and the housing system. In short, our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus, leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having a new purpose to grow opportunity in our society. We do this through a transformation of the incentives.


## A Theory of Change

The way that we need to set up this tax system needs to maximise the effect whilst minimising the resistance. It's this sort of system that can maximise the good that can be achieved. This is true in two areas in particular: in environmental/energy policy and in housing policy. If you want to have a big effect, you need a big incentive. But big incentives cause big losers and therefore, political resistance. In other words, we use financial incentives to promote wider forms of entrepreneurship for public benefit.

What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, good and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately. 

## Plan of the Book

This chapter considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasizing where() perhaps(!) our ideas are new or innovative.  

Chapter 1 defines a new economic model. It defines the economic objective as preserving and enhancing genuine wealth rather than activity and defines wealth at four levels.

Chapter 2A considers economic reform and economic justice in history, starting with Adam Smith. It introduces the Adam Smith model as a point of departure.

Chapter 2B outlines the principles of the Beveridge report. Like Beveridge, we want to produce a *radical, comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

Chapter 3 builds a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal, we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the most important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. [To Be Implemented: Empirically, we should ask the hypothetical question: *How would the world be different if this or that assumption were true?*. We then use quantitative data to see which assumption is appropriate.]

Chapter 4 builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes, we seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such as climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to fairly transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Chapter 5 considers tax in principle. It considers the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. *Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing any tax or system of taxation. Each category covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions. It defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, good and practical tax system. 

Chapter 6 considers tax in practice. We look in detail at the margins of tax avoidance.

Chapters 7--12 consider the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality seems to be driven not only by the difference in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation. Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sectors, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them. We then apply these ideas to the sectors of the economy.

Chapter 13--15 contain our proposals and the quantitative modelling work on them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented. We outline our proposals, model them and conclude the book in part 16. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.
