# PART 0. INTRODUCTION

# Story: Turning the Ship away from the Perfect Storm

The film 'A Perfect Storm' describes a true story of a fishing trawler facing a particularly wicked storm. A ship's captain and his fellow New England fishermen had fallen on hard times after poor catches. The captain, played by George Clooney, had assembled a crew and hired a boat to go out for one last fishing trip before the fishing season was out. They sailed out into the mid-Atlantic. After much fruitless searching, they finally struck fish and turned for home, hoping to get the catch back whilst still fresh. 

Unfortunately, a storm was brewing, and not just any storm. Three separate weather systems had merged to create a 'weather bomb', a storm of unsual intensity. Meteorologists warned of a serious threat to any fishing boats that braved what would become an epic storm. The fishermen faced a difficult question. Should the attempt to land their catch whilst still fresh by heading straight home through the storm. Or shoudl they avoid the storm by staying in the mid-Atlantic until the weather system passed, and risk the fish being no longer fresh enough to sell once they returned to port. Added to this dilemma were communications and leadership difficulties. Communications between the weather forecasters and the boat were interrupted by the degradation of the communications system on the boat. The captain, whilst charismatic, also was hubristic and lacked good judgment.

It seems odd that Clooney and his men took such a severe risk. Why were they in that situation in the first place? There are two underlying reasons: environmental damage and economic insecurity. 

First, the seas were no longer as plentiful as they once were. In the past [when?] the Grand Banks off Newfoundland teemed with fish. But overfishing led to a collapse in fish stocks. Similarly, the fishermen whilst having a valuable profession, do not own exclusive rights to fish. 

Second, the fishermen lacked economic security in their lives. They had to fish or go bust. Beyond their own homes, they owned little. Their boats were owned by investors who expected a return and did nothing so dangerous as to actually head out to sea. An absentee landlord, he simply rented out the boat and lived off the surplus. We never meet him, but his presence makes himself felt. The fishermen were economically expendable, a bit like the low-value fish that are thrown off the side of the boat.

What has this perfect storm got to do with the global situation? Quite a lot, perhaps. We, on Earth, are facing a similar situation to Clooney's character and his crew. There are warnings of a dangerous future clmate for the planet on the path currently taken. Clever people disagree over whether to take the environmental warning seriously or not. Some think it's all a hoax, others say it's just natural variability. We need to decide how to interpret these warnings -- whether to ignore them, like the fateful crew in Clooney's boat, or to take them seriously. 

But even if we don't ignore the warnings, we have another problem. You and I don't control the direction of the world economy. There is no single captain of the good ship Earth.

To change direction of the ship we also need to understand the controls. This book is about a particular set of controls on our economic system. Like Clooney's ship has a motor and a rudder, to control its direction, we argue that the economy also has a set of controls which determine the direction it takes. These controls are the systems of taxation, property and finance, which are the scope of this book. This book attempts to use the tax and financial system to change the incentives of the private sector to do the right thing. And it deals with the question of how to make the change.

But isn't this very collectivist? Surely, the interests of people are rightly individually determined? People should be free to do what they want, without the government directing them. And hasn't the market economy had a good record? We are richer, more secure, and have a lower chance of dying than previous times. 

This book argues that this is all true, but we should note something else. As the world economy becomes more integrated, the fate of each of us is more strongly linked to evyone else. The members of Clooney crew might well have different preferences. Some wanted to get home early to see their loved ones, others wanted to stay out at sea to make money. But the fate of the crew was also linked. Nobody really had the choice to exit the boat early. They had to decide together on the course. 

As the world economy becomes more linked, and as we reach the planetary boundaries of how much humanity can exploit nature without serious consequences, we also find our fates more heavily linked. Whatever our individual preferences are, we also face issues in common. And thus, we need everyone on the boat to be contributing positively to the correct decision and the correct outcome that preserves the people and nature. 

After all, we are, globally, in the same boat and will live or die together.

# Key Message

This book is about the economic conditions for widely-spread and sustainable prosperity. Why, given great technological and economic progress, do we still have problems? Why, amidst so much wealth, are our lives so economically precarious? If in the 1960s, it took an average person in the UK on average wages four years wages to buy their own home, why now does it take an average person on average wages ten years buy the same home -- if, that is, they have anything left over to save up after paying their current landlord? If we have all the technology to solve our environmental problems -- climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing for example -- then why are we not solving these problems? If we can find the root cause, then we will perhaps be able to find a remedy.  

The 19th century writer Henry George’s book *Progress and Poverty* also asked a similar question. Why, given technological progress, did we still have so much poverty? He argued  that it was the private ownership of land that caused poverty. And that problem still arises today. It's the location of houses that gives them their value. the reason we cannot easily buy a good home, is that the land underneath the home is privately owned and highly valuable. George argued to tax land value and to eliminate other taxes. 

Today we face the same problem, but also environmental destruction. We have a market economy, in most of the world, with competition, growth and technological progress. But we still have economic precariousness and environmental pollution, despite having the wealth and technological ability to prevent them. Our economic system is not allowing us to take full advantage of the progress that we make. So why do we have these problems of pollution and precariousness? We identify three phenomena described by the great economists. 

We call the first notion 'economic theft'. Economic theft (negative externalities) is when one person or company’s behaviour damages another person or the environment where the first person does not pay for it. So for example, if I throw my plastic waste into the ocean, it can then damage fish and other marine life. My careless action has stolen from the future of the ocean. 

We call the second notion spillover benefit. In this case, my actions create benefits for someone else or for the natural environment but I am not paid for it. 

We call the third notion generalised rent. Imagine I am a landlord. Once I own some land with property on it, I can simply sit back and enjoy the flow of income, without having to work. This flow of income is called rent. Rent goes up, as wages increase. Similarly if i own a big monopoly with no competition, I can also own a permanent flow of profits that competition will not touch. We term these two forms of property income 'generalised rent'. Generalised rent is a permanent flow of income associated with an asset that cannot be replicated. 

The result of these three economic effects is that we have too much pollution, not enough genuine wealth and economic growth that benefit the rich unfairly. In some countries, economic growth may even stop. For the planet as a whole, this model is catastrophic. This book shows a route out of this economic situation.

Economists have been aware of these effects for some time. Yet, taxes which would correct these economic distortions have only been occasionally and partially imposed. Why haven’t corrective taxes been imposed? The common answer is that taxes on rent and economic theft (negative externalities) threaten powerful interests. This view has some merit. However, there is another problem. Nobody has made a sufficiently passionate and positive case for these taxes. This book aims to correct that. 

In addition, economists should work out ways to impose such taxes whilst minimising the resistance to them. Resistance to taxes is associated with concentrated losses by specific groups. These groups can easily mobilise to resist the tax. So taxes which would change the incentives at the nature of these agents cannot be imposed because the very same agents resist them. 

In this book, we suggest a simple model. Rather than impose a blunt tax which just charges for economic rent or economic theft, we should recognise that the agent engaging in rent extraction or pollution have done so because of a societal norm. The role of taxes should be to both recognise the validity of their prior behaviour and to change it. This is what we call a norm and incentive based taxation system. To put in more concrete terms, we need to give individuals and companies strong incentives to change behaviour whilst not threatening their financial interests. The tax gives the relevant company an incentive to change its nature but does not directly threaten its interests. 

Applying this model to greenhouse gas solutions gives us a feebate. A feebate would charge electricity producers for their fossil fuel inputs and would subsidise them for their production of electricity per kilowatt hour (kwh) produced. 
Applying this model to wealth, we would charge for both the extraction of economic rent but rebate any spillover benefits produced. 

## Economic Thought

Economics is the study of activities that are at least in part motivated by financial gain or that involves resources that are inherently scarce. Economics used to be called political economy. This comes from ancient Greek roots. Political in an older sense means ‘in relation to the polis’. Polis in turn means the city-state, the name for political organisation in ancient Greece. Economy comes from two Greek words Oikos, meaning household and Nomos meaning a law. Therefore, oikonomos means household management and, in English, political economy comes from the notion of household management of the state. If household management involves budgeting and the management of financial matters and also commodity needs, political economy is about state managing the same -- financial and commodity needs. 

Classical political economy -- the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx -- was written in prose. Modern economics is often written in Maths! Classical political economy dealt with the economy as a dynamic process and did not shy away from grand  about divisive topics, in particular, the question of how the economy distributed its gains. Thus, the great works of political economy by the great authors above always had questions of taxation at their heart. What is an efficient and fair taxation system given what we know about the principles of political economy?  Thus, the economic problem of distribution and taxation as a means to improve distribution have always been at the heart of political economy. 

This makes political economy and now economics very powerful. It also means that economics has implications for the financial interests of everyone. We can believe an economic theory for scientific reasons but we might also support some theory because it furthers our own selfish interests. This makes political and economic discourse somewhat fraught and it means that there is a suspicion that the corrupting power of self interest may affect the balance of those economic theories that are thought authoritative. In this book, we aim to reconcile classical, neoclassical, Keynesian and ecological and system dynamic thinking.   

In our chapter on economics in the book, we define some world classical economic problems. One central question is how are prices determined? From this question, we can ask how does the economy distribute the gains from economic progress? We can also ask whether self-interest and the free market provide a desirable outcome? 

Both of these questions are related not only to economic processes of for example, production and competition but also to the structure of private property and taxation. What things can be owned? And who in fact owns those things? And how much tax do they pay for owning those things or for engaging in some economic activity? It has been a contention of great economists that desirable economy outcomes depend not only on the structure of economic activity -- for example, whether   ????


Adam Smith, in his famous work, The Wealth of Nations, set out an economic model of how societies could actually wisely spread prosperity. He argued that the division of labour leads to higher levels of productivity. If an entrepreneur makes an improvement in production processes, he can lower his cost of production and still sell at the price of his competitors. In other words, he can make a profit. In the short term therefore, the advantages of his improvement accrue to him. Thus, the profit motive provides an incentive to make improvements. However, his competitors may notice the improvement that he has made and replicate it. In order to capture market share, then they will be able to lower their prices. After all the competition has taken its course, we will be left with a different situation. The price of the good concerned will have fallen to just above the new production cost. Therefore, the altered beneficiary of the technological improvement would be everyone who purchases the product concerned. In other words, technological progress, the profit motive and the process of competition leads to widely spread prosperity. 

This model relies on certain assumptions. Principally, a production process, once improved, can also be replicated. There must be enough market participants for competition to work. If there is only a single monopolist or if entrance to the market is very expensive, then competition will not work as described. Instead, the beneficiary of economic activity and improvement of technological processes will be the owners of the single monopolist or the incumbent firm. 

If the process relies on some factor of production that cannot be replicated, for example, land, then the beneficiary of the economic progress will be the landlords. 

Usually, damaging other people or their interests for example, through injury or theft is illegal. But some economic activity which damages others is still legal. This is true, for example, in the case of pollution or traffic accidents or unhealthy food. In these cases, whilst these activities are legal and are also normal, they are nevertheless damaging. Small, indirect damages from many independent sources can add up to a lot in total. What seems acceptable when societies are small may nevertheless be unacceptable when societies grow large. For example, Newfoundland fishermen could fish without constraints when their boats were small and their numbers low. There were plenty of fish. However, fish stocks are not unlimited. There is a limit on many fish can be taken before it damages the fishery. If too many fish are taken, then the fish don’t get a chance to reproduce and the fish stocks collapse. This is what happened on the ground at Newfoundland. Fish used to be so plentiful that you could almost walk on water. But after the collapse in the fish stock, many fishermen went out of business.       

## Taxation Thought

One key challenge to taxation is working out a means of taxation that can tax wealth and flows of income across international boundaries. Generally, the purported issue is as follows: One cannot tax big companies or rich individuals because they will simply move their money abroad. Furthermore, we might even wish to reduce our taxes on companies in order to encourage them to locate in our country. This is problematic. 

Such a challenge also applies to the taxation of fossil fuels. If we tax emissions that are produced in the UK, this might encourage UK based producers to relocate to outside of the taxation zone. However, if instead we tax emissions according to the end consumer, this would mean that imports of goods with high emissions would also be taxed. This would be helpful because firstly, it would give a true picture of the emissions that a country is responsible for due to its consumption behaviour, and secondly, it creates a true incentive for countries that produce the goods that UK consumers consume to themselves decarbonise their economy. Thirdly, taxing carbon in this way encourages the changes that we want namely, changes to production processes to reduce emissions rather than simply relocation of dirty industries abroad. 

Taxation of wealth also faces similar issues. It is the purpose of the taxation theory to identify a base of taxation that is unresponsive to the tax. So in taxing wealth, we could argue for taxation of assets rather than taxation of wealthy individuals. Land is a straightforward asset to tax in this way. Land cannot just move out of the country. Taxing corporate wealth is more difficult. We need to seek a basis of taxation that is unavoidable. In this book, we suggest two radical strategies. The first is the taxation of profit based on a formula of UK sales minus UK costs. This actually encourages companies to locate their costs in the UK. The higher the tax rate, the more operations would be moved to a UK base. The second is an apportionment of multi-national wealth based on where their sales are located. In both these cases, we use consumption as an inelastic tax base.        

# Scope

## A New Economic Model
This book is addressed to those who are looking for a new economic model for rich and poor countries across the world. The intended audience includes economists, scientists, politicians, businesspeople, other professionals, and interested members of the general public.

## Problems in Scope
It is concerned with how to pay for public services and social protection in a world characterised by 'wicked externalities', 'generalised rent',  and 'international flows of money and assets'. Wicked externalities, such as climate change, are damages caused by our actions that affect others remote in time and space, without governance systems to constrain them. Generalised rent is a permanent financial surplus received by the owners of properties in valuable locations and the shareholders of large companies, leading to expensive housing, stagnating wages and wealth gains for the already rich. International tax avoidance leads to multinational companies and rich individuals failing to pay their fair share for society's upkeep. 

## Tools In Scope
The central concern of the book is the use of the tax system for public benefit: to solve the critical challenges facing our societies including climate change, poverty and the complexity, avoidance and evasion in our taxation and welfare systems. The book proposes a simple and effective tax and social security system to solve these problems and to enhance genuine wealth at the level of the individual, community, nation state and planet.

We are interested in two other systems in particular that overlap with the tax system: the financial and monetary system, the social security (also known as welfare or 'benefits') system including skills training. The examples given relate to the reform of the UK tax and welfare system, but the ideas herein are intended to be applicable to most societies around the world. Out of scope is the detail of the benefits system and the detailed technicalities of how some taxes work at the moment. We keep it to the broad scale big picture more than the accounting of taxes, although we do cover some implementation choices.

## Systems in Scope
We are fundamentally interested in an economy that is fit for our children. This means that we need thje *private sector* to have the right incentives. So there are two, distinct systems that are in scope of our book. The first is, in a sense, the entire private secotor. We argue that if the private sector does not have the right incentives it will not produce the right outcomes. The second system is more technocratic: the taxation system itself, whether it works competently. The final stystem is the system of popular accountability, the question of how the taxation and welfare system can actually be *changed* by both popular will and academic thought. Is it impossible to change the systems driving our future? We argue that it is not.


# Recapitulation 
## An Economy Fit for Our Children

There has been tremendous technological progress and economic growth. But we still have problems. Those problems can perhaps be described as on one hand economic insecurity and on the other hand, damaging our ecological environment. Thus, we need an economics that not only considers the parts of the economy that are additive (growth economics) but also those that are fixed (distribution economics) and those that are subtractable (environmental economics).

What would an economy fit for our children look like? I think it would have two important aspects. Firstly, the beautiful things that require care, like the natural environment, would be preserved. Second, the limited things would not be preserved.

This book is about economics for a certain type of world. In this world, there are some goods that can be added to, either in quantity or quality; there are some goods that are fundamentally fixed; and there are some goods that can be degraded or destroyed. By 'goods' I mean broadly useful natural or artificial things. These positive, limited or negative things can apply to both public and private goods. 

Environmental economists distinguish between goods that are *excludible* and those that are *rival*. Related to rivalness is *subtractability*. So pure public goods are non-rival and non-excludable. Club goods (for example, watching a pay-per-view sports match) are non-rival (it doesn't cost anything for someone extra to watch it) but excludible. Common pool resources are rival but non-excludible. They are also subtractable.


## Economics, Opportunity and Hope

This book provides hope that our societies can fix our big problems. Many people, across the west, whether they are rich or poor, are starting to lose hope. The poor are losing hope because their economic situation is often precarious. The well informed are starting to lose hope that our society can fix its critical issues, primarily climate change. The super rich on the other hand are building bunkers and preparing for the worst. This book gives us justified hope. Justified hope that humanity can continue to solve our problems.

Tax is the means by which we pay for government services. But this book isn't really about government. This book is about how the private sector can contribute to the well being and the good of society. Therefore it is a book about economics. That is not to say that the government can't do good and important things. But if the private sector is not to do bad things for our general well-being, then the right tax system needs to be in place. Such a tax system taxes bad things, not good things. And taxes unearned wealth rather than the median wage 'just about getting by' income that most people have.

An economy that is good for people and for the planet is also one that is functioning well. Whilst there are things for us all to do, there are opportunities for development and growth, including in rich countries. But that growth, where it is in relation to consumption, needs to be dematerialised or physically circular: it needs to minimise the impact that the growth has on the natural world. We will come to how to achieve that a little later. The main point is that the physical use of natural resources should be taxed, and the circular use of those resources is thereby encouraged.

A good society promotes the wealth and happiness of its citizens. Thus, we argue for a society and economy that defines, preserves or creates, and fairly distributes natural and humanly-created wealth. Happiness implies a different metric than mere activity: humans need both security and purpose. The challenges of the future give us our purpose and will undermine our security if we do not face them with full commitment. 

Our vision of the tax system interacts with the benefits and training system, the finance system, the energy system and the housing system. In short, our vision is for a new tax and welfare system that taxes the right things and thus, leads to the production and preservation of wealth rather than the extraction and enclosure of wealth by those with more power. In other words, it leads to the private sector having a new purpose to grow opportunity in our society. We do this through a transformation of the incentives.


## A Theory of Change

The way that we need to set up this tax system needs to maximise the effect whilst minimising the resistance. It's this sort of system that can maximise the good that can be achieved. This is true in two areas in particular: in environmental/energy policy and in housing policy. If you want to have a big effect, you need a big incentive. But big incentives cause big losers and therefore, political resistance. In other words, we use financial incentives to promote wider forms of entrepreneurship for public benefit.

What can individuals and groups do to promote a better tax and welfare system? Economic justice campaigners seek to eliminate the evident unfairness of the current taxation and benefits system. Environmental and housing tax campaigners seek to use the tax system to make the private sector work for greater public good. Simplicity campaigners seek a simpler, more usable system. Tax Heaven combines these motivations to argue for a fair, good and simple tax and social security system. It provides a rallying point of key ideas that could be implemented immediately. 

# Plan of the Book

This chapter considers the core questions and theses of the book, emphasizing where() perhaps(!) our ideas are new or innovative.  

Chapter 1 defines a new economic model. It defines the economic objective as preserving and enhancing genuine wealth rather than activity and defines wealth at four levels.

Chapter 2A considers economic reform and economic justice in history, starting with Adam Smith. It introduces the Adam Smith model as a point of departure.

Chapter 2B outlines the principles of the Beveridge report. Like Beveridge, we want to produce a *radical, comprehensive* analysis of tax and welfare that provides the basis of a new *social contract* between individuals and the state.

Chapter 3 builds a conceptual model of the economy. To assess any policy proposal, we need a model of the world accurate for the purposes to which we put it. No model of the world is completely accurate. But we do need a model that deals with the most important economic, social and environmental phenomena in it. Without that, our advice will be askew. We set out key ideas and how they make our picture of the world richer and more realistic. [To Be Implemented: Empirically, we should ask the hypothetical question: *How would the world be different if this or that assumption were true?*. We then use quantitative data to see which assumption is appropriate.]

Chapter 4 builds a conceptual model of politics. We mention briefly some simple ideas in power politics, the economics of collective action and the legal and political institutions available to us to fix global problems. Sometimes, we seem to lack the capacity to tackle international issues such as climate change and tax evasion. We define a better way forward, consistent with the requirements of the future and the institutional tools available to us. We consider what is realistically needed to fairly transition to a better system in a popular fashion.

Chapter 5 considers tax in principle. It considers the work of great economists and other thinkers on these topics. *Beneficial, fair,* and *practical* are three general categories which provide us with a framework for assessing any tax or system of taxation. Each category covers various elements and includes areas where people may reasonably hold differing opinions. It defines 'Tax Heaven' as a fair, good and practical tax system. 

Chapter 6 considers tax in practice. We look in detail at the margins of tax avoidance.

Chapters 7--12 consider the sectors of the economy and their challenges. Inequality seems to be driven not only by the difference in merit but also by tax evasion and avoidance, and by unfair processes of asset price appreciation. Housing is increasingly unaffordable in many cities. Climate change and other environmental issues threaten the future of our living planet. Automation and artificial intelligence question the future of work. This section considers these sectors, their problems and some tax and benefit solutions to them. We then apply these ideas to the sectors of the economy.

Chapter 13--15 contain our proposals and the quantitative modelling work on them. We use computer models to suggest the likely outcome if a recommended set of policies is implemented. We outline our proposals, model them and conclude the book in part 16. We consider any implementation challenges and how they can be overcome. We conclude the book with a rallying cry and a practical way forward.
