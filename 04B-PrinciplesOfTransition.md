# 04B Principles of Transition



*Transition*

Any new tax system will involve a transition from the existing to the new. Working out such a transition is as important as working out where the direction of a tax system should eventually go. Such a transition should be fair and politically feasible and also it should demonstrate the viability of the policies implemented by proving to a skeptical public their value. In order to transition from the current system to one that works more effectively in a fashion that is smooth and politically feasible, we set out some suggestions on principles of transition. 

 

### Principle 1: Visionary

The desired state and the objectives of the move should be clear .

### Principle 2: Packaged Change

The change in the tax system should be packaged into a policy proposal that can be implemented in the current system.

### Principle 3: Political Feasibility: Rhetorical

The change should be expressible in simple and compelling arguments.

### Principle 4: Political Feasibility: Few Losers

The change should create a few losers, in other words, they should not be significant, well organized groups that lose out. If there are losers, then those losers should be disarmed by the rhetorical purpose of the policy.

### Principle 5: Expert Assent

The change should have experts willing to support it. These experts should be credible and authoritative.

 

 

##   The following table shows both the final strategic objective and the intermediate/transitional one. 



 

| **Policy Area**                    | **Initial, Intermediate   Approach**                         | **Final Objective**                                          |
