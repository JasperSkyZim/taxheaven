# 11. Radical Reform of the VAT and Corporation Tax system
Our objectives for reform of VAT and Corporation tax are as follows:
Help exporters
Help companies with large investment needs
Remove the tax advantage of debt over equity


In this section we keep our overall goal in mind – to reform the tax system so that it rewards wealth creation in the UK (in particular capital formation and exports). We also want to find a solution that avoids the 'race to the bottom' of international corporate tax rates - that is good for the UK and yet does not lead to a sub-optimal Here we suggest a reform of the VAT and existing corporation tax system that does that. 
A corporation tax is a tax on company profits.What is the purpose of the Corporation Tax system? The Canadian Carter commission report argued that the purpose would be "(i) to be a backstop to the personal income tax, and (ii) to tax foreigners on their income” earned in the domestic country (i.e. Canada). So corporate income is taxed first and then the tax paid is credited back when dividend payments are made.
Cash-flow, destination basis corporate tax, exempting exporters, capital investment and R and D but including interest payments.
Corporation Tax has problems. 
First we outline the approach to the two taxes at present.
It's purpose is to tax foreigners on cash earned in the UK; and perhaps to prevent various forms of tax arbitrage (for example keeping profits in the company). 
Our proposal here is to unify VAT and corporation tax under a company cashflow tax. This is similar to a VAT. It is described in detail by Auerbach (ref).
Under a cashflow tax, incoming payments are taxed (including domestic sales, wages, borrowing), and outgoing payments are refunded (including cost of sales, sub-contractors, wages, dividends, interest and principal repayments ). This is similar to a VAT, except that wages are deductible and debt is treated on a consistent basis to equity. Just like VAT, exports would not be taxable (we ignore EEA issues for now), and imports would be taxable. 
Moving to such a system has potential advantages. It would favour exporters and those willing to invest. Rather than the distinction between large and small companies, we would make the distinction between exporters in competitive markets and domestic producers which may or may not be competitive. If an exporter is earning large profits from exports, that is something to be celebrated and that money should be available for investment (and the investment should be tax deductible). 
Combining a cashflow tax with a source-based flat or single-rate tax (I define a 'single-rate' tax to be a flat tax with a personal allowance - a residency-based work based tax rebate), makes a lot of sense. A flat tax collected on a source basis can cover.
So one example set-up would be to combine a 40% single-rate tax with a 40% corporate tax (0% on exports and with investment deductible). VAT would be abolished. In this case, a domestic-sales company (including foreign-located and foreign-owned sellers in British markets) would pay 40% on retained earnings.
40% might sound a lot, but it's important to note that exporters pay nothing and there are much greater deduct-abilities than before – and VAT is being combined with corporation tax here. Concerns
One concern is that VAT is required at a European level; however, since what we are doing is simply exempting income tax, the same result can be achieved by higher VAT and lower income tax - unfortunately the VAT rate would be VERY high (since VAT is charge additively, the equivalent additive rate for a 40% subtract is (0.6/0.4)-1, i.e. 50% (quite an increase on current VAT rates).
If such a tax were introduced, some account would need to be taken of domestic rents exported (e.g. foreigners buying fossil fuels or staying in hotels). A source based rent tax would be even more necessary.

**Radical Reform of the VAT and Corporation Tax system**
This section considers reform of the corporation tax system. Our goal is a system of company taxation that rewards exporting companies and all those that invest in physical capital expenditure in the UK. We also want to find a solution that avoids the 'race to the bottom' of international corporate tax rates.

A corporation tax is a tax on company profits. It generally covers both profits retained within the company (retained earnings) and those paid out as dividends (distributed earnings). A credit is applied to income tax on 

But should we have a corporate tax at all? Since companies are owned by individuals, might it not be simpler to tax individuals rather than companies? What, in fact, is the purpose of the Corporation Tax system? 

The Canadian Carter report argued that the purpose is " (i) to be a backstop to the personal income tax, and (ii) to tax foreigners on their income earned in Canada".

If foreigners own a British company,
